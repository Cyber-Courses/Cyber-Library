# 1433 - Pentesting MSSQL - Microsoft SQL Server


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> 1433 - Pentesting MSSQL is a method of assessing the security of Microsoft SQL Server by simulating an attack from a malicious source. The fundamental concepts of this method are network security, SQL Server system, and penetration testing techniques.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Microsoft SQL Server is a widely used database management system. Ensuring its security is of paramount importance as it often contains sensitive data. Penetration testing is a proactive approach to discovering any potential vulnerabilities and fixing them before an actual attacker exploits them. Hence, understanding 1433 - Pentesting MSSQL is crucial for anyone involved in the security management of systems running Microsoft SQL Server.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To carry out 1433 - Pentesting MSSQL, you need to follow several steps. 1) Information Gathering: This involves identifying the target SQL Server and gathering as much information as possible. 2) Scanning: Use tools like Nmap or Nessus to scan the target for any open ports or vulnerabilities. 3) Exploitation: If any vulnerabilities are found, use them to gain unauthorized access to the server. 4) Post-Exploitation: Once access is gained, look for sensitive data, and test further to see the extent of the compromise. 5) Reporting: Document all the findings, suggest countermeasures and present to the concerned parties.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Penetration testing should be done regularly, especially after any significant changes to the SQL server system or its network environment. However, the exact timing depends on the organization's security policy and the criticality of the systems involved.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Microsoft SQL Server uses 1433 as its default port. In a penetration testing (aka pentesting) context, a tester exploits this fact to assess the system's security. The process begins by establishing a connection to port 1433 to check for server response. A responsive server indicates a potential entry point.

The tester then attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities or use brute force attacks to gain unauthorized access. Known vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the system that have been discovered and documented. Brute force attacks involve trying numerous combinations of usernames and passwords until one is successful.

Once access is gained, the tester assesses the security level of databases, tables, stored procedures, and other server objects. These objects can contain sensitive data, so understanding their security level is crucial. The tester may also attempt to escalate their privileges within the system, execute commands, or perform other malicious activities. These actions are not to cause harm but to understand what a genuine attacker could do.

The final part of the process is reporting. The tester documents all findings, including any vulnerabilities exploited, data accessed, and malicious activities possible. The report will also suggest countermeasures to mitigate the discovered risks. The objective of penetration testing is to proactively identify potential security issues and fix them before real attackers can exploit them. Therefore, this process is crucial for any organization that prioritizes its data security.

For example, let's consider we have a target SQL Server with IP address 192.168.0.10.

1. **Information Gathering:** We can use the `ping` command to check if the server is responsive.
    
    ```
    ping 192.168.0.10
    
    ```
    
    A successful ping means the server is responsive.
    
2. **Scanning:** We can use Nmap, a popular network scanning tool, to scan our target for open ports and possible vulnerabilities. The command might be:
    
    ```
    nmap -p 1433 192.168.0.10
    
    ```
    
    This command scans the server at IP address 192.168.0.10 on port 1433.
    
3. **Exploitation:** If the scan shows port 1433 is open, we can use a tool like `sqlmap` to try and exploit any SQL injection vulnerabilities. For example:
    
    ```
    sqlmap -u "<http://192.168.0.10/index.php?id=1>" --dbms=MSSQL
    
    ```
    
    This command uses sqlmap to test the specified URL for SQL injection vulnerabilities. The `--dbms=MSSQL` flag tells sqlmap that the database system is MSSQL.
    
4. **Post-Exploitation:** If we manage to gain access, we can use the `sqlmap` tool to enumerate the database and retrieve data from the server. For example:
    
    ```
    sqlmap -u "<http://192.168.0.10/index.php?id=1>" --dbms=MSSQL --dbs
    
    ```
    
    This command tells sqlmap to list all the databases present in the system.
    
5. **Reporting:** After all the steps, we document our findings. This includes the vulnerabilities we found, the data we could access, and the potential harm an attacker could do. We also suggest countermeasures to mitigate the risks. For example, suggesting that the server administrator close unused ports, update the system to patch known vulnerabilities, and enforce strong password policies.

Remember, this is just an example for educational purposes. In practice, penetration testing should only be performed by authorized professionals and on systems where explicit permission has been given.
