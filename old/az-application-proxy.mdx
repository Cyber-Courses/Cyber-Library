# Az - Application Proxy


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Azure Application Proxy is a service part of Azure AD that enables users to access remotely their on-premises web applications. It provides secure remote access to web applications without changing or exposing your network infrastructure.


### 🧐 Why ?

It's important because it allows secure access to web applications without the need for VPN or changing firewall rules. It also provides single sign-on and multifactor authentication, enhancing user experience and security.


### ⛏️ How ?

To implement Azure Application Proxy, first, you need to have an Azure AD tenant, then you need to enable Application Proxy in the Azure portal. After that, you install a connector on your network, and finally, you publish your applications to be accessed remotely.


### ⏳ When ?

Azure Application Proxy was first introduced by Microsoft in 2014 as a part of Azure AD services.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Azure Application Proxy works by installing a connector in your internal network. This connector makes outbound connections to the Application Proxy services in Azure. When a user tries to access an application, the request goes to the Azure AD, it then uses the connector to reach the internal application. The response is then sent back to the user through the same path. The connection is secured and doesn’t require any changes in your firewall.
