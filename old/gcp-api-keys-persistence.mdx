# GCP - API Keys Persistence


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> GCP (Google Cloud Platform) API Keys Persistence refers to the process of managing and using Google's service account keys within the cloud environment. These keys are essentially the credentials that allow applications to authenticate and authorize actions within GCP services.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding GCP API Keys Persistence is essential for managing and securing your cloud-based applications. API Keys are the gateways to accessing and manipulating resources in your GCP environment. Mismanagement or exposure of these keys can lead to unauthorized access and potential security threats.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use GCP API Keys Persistence, you first need to generate service account keys from the GCP console, which can then be used to authenticate your applications. It is crucial to restrict and monitor the usage of these keys, and regularly rotate them to maintain a high level of security.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The use of API keys for managing access to cloud resources has been a common practice since the advent of cloud computing. With the introduction of GCP, this practice has been further standardized and made more secure.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

GCP API Keys Persistence involves the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) which are generated when a service account key is created. These tokens are used to authenticate the service account associated with the application making a request to a GCP service. The service then authorizes the request based on the permissions associated with the service account. It's essential to keep these keys secure as they can be used to gain unauthorized access to resources if they fall into the wrong hands. Using techniques like key rotation and least privilege principle can significantly enhance the security posture of your GCP environment.
