# Format Strings Template


# üëâ¬†Overview

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> A format string template is a way to format strings in Python. It allows variable substitutions and value formatting within strings. This method of string formatting is often preferred for its readability and ease of use.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Format string templates are important because they provide a flexible and efficient way to handle and manipulate strings in Python. This feature is particularly useful in cases where you need to include variable data within a string, such as in logs, user notifications, or complex print statements. Understanding how to use format strings can greatly simplify your code and make it more readable and maintainable.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use a format string template, you start with a string that contains placeholders, denoted by curly braces {}. You can put variables or expressions inside the curly braces, and they will be evaluated and inserted into the string when it is formatted. For example: name = 'Alice'; print(f'Hello {name}') will output 'Hello Alice'. You can also format the values by including a format specification after the variable or expression, separated by a colon. For example: number = 12345.6789; print(f'{number:.2f}') will output '12345.68'.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Format strings were introduced in Python 3.6 as a new and improved way to format strings. They have since become a popular feature due to their simplicity and flexibility.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Format strings, introduced in Python 3.6, use interpolation to provide a versatile and efficient way to format and manipulate strings. The process starts when a format string is evaluated by the Python interpreter. The interpreter scans the format string from left to right, looking for opening curly braces {}.

When an opening brace is identified, the interpreter treats the following text as a variable or expression to be evaluated. This allows you to embed variables directly into a string. For instance, if you have a variable `name` set to 'Alice', you can use a format string to print a greeting to Alice by writing `print(f'Hello {name}')`, which will output 'Hello Alice'.

If the interpreter encounters a colon (:) within the curly braces, it interprets the text after the colon as a format specification. This format specification can control how the value is converted into a string. For example, it can dictate the number of decimal places for a floating point number. If you have a variable `number` set to 12345.6789, you can limit the decimal places to two by writing `print(f'{number:.2f}')`, which will output '12345.68'.

Format specifications can also control the field width for a string, amongst other things. For example, if you want to create a string of a certain length, you can use a format specification like `{var:10}` to create a string that is ten characters long.

Finally, once the Python interpreter reaches the closing curly braces, it inserts the evaluated value into the string in place of the braces and any contained code. This process is repeated for every pair of curly braces in the string, allowing multiple variables or expressions to be evaluated and inserted into a single string.

By understanding and using format strings effectively, you can greatly simplify your Python code and make it more readable and maintainable.

Here is a detailed example of using format strings in Python:

```python
# Define some variables
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 1.68

# Use a format string to create a sentence that includes these variables
sentence = f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old and my height is {height:.2f} meters."

# Print the sentence
print(sentence)

```

In the above Python code:

1. We first define three variables: `name`, `age`, and `height`. These variables hold the values "Alice", 25, and 1.68 respectively.
2. We then create a format string, denoted by the `f` before the opening quote. Within this string, we include our variables inside curly braces `{}`. This tells Python to replace the curly braces and the variable name with the value of the variable.
3. Inside the curly braces for the `height` variable, we include `:.2f` after the variable name. This is a format specification, which tells Python to format the value as a floating point number with two decimal places.
4. Finally, we print the sentence. The output will be: `My name is Alice, I am 25 years old and my height is 1.68 meters.`

By using a format string, we can easily create a complex string that includes variable values, with control over how those values are formatted and displayed.
