# 9000 - Pentesting FastCGI


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

FastCGI is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server. FastCGI's main aim is to reduce the overhead related to interfacing between web server and CGI programs, allowing a server to handle more web page requests per unit of time.


### üßê¬†Why ?

FastCGI pentesting is important because it allows cybersecurity professionals to discover security vulnerabilities within a FastCGI configuration, potentially preventing malicious attacks and securing sensitive data. It is useful for readers to understand this topic because it highlights the importance of maintaining secure server configurations and demonstrates a practical application of pentesting techniques.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To conduct FastCGI pentesting, you would typically start by identifying the FastCGI service and its version. Next, you would search for known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the identified service and attempt to exploit them. It's critical to always follow ethical guidelines when performing these tests, only testing systems you have permission to access.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

FastCGI pentesting has become increasingly relevant with the widespread use of FastCGI in modern web servers. The practice of pentesting itself has been around since the inception of the internet, but specific techniques and targets, such as FastCGI, have evolved over time as technology has advanced.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

FastCGI is a binary protocol that serves as an interface between web servers and interactive programs. It was developed as an alternative to the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to minimize the overhead associated with interfacing between a web server and CGI programs, thereby enhancing the server's ability to handle more web page requests concurrently.

The key difference between FastCGI and CGI is the way they manage processes. In CGI, a new process is created and destroyed for each request, which can lead to significant overhead, especially for busy servers. On the other hand, FastCGI reuses processes to service multiple requests, which dramatically reduces overhead and improves performance.

FastCGI operates by maintaining persistent CGI processes that live between requests to handle the execution of programs. It also multiplexes the CGI processing across multiple operations, which can be performed on various processors.

During penetration testing (pentesting) of FastCGI, the tester identifies the FastCGI service and its version. They then search for any known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the service and attempt to exploit them. Some typical vulnerabilities that might be found include a chance to execute remote code, unauthorized system access, or sensitive information leaks.

It's important to note that pentesting should always be conducted ethically, meaning the tester should only attempt to exploit systems they have explicit permission to test.

Understanding FastCGI and its potential vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining secure server configurations, protecting sensitive data, and preventing malicious attacks.

For example, let's assume we have permission to test a server running FastCGI. We start by identifying the service and its version using a tool like `nmap`:

```
nmap -sV -p 9000 target_server_ip

```

This command scans the specified port (9000, commonly used by FastCGI) on the target server and identifies the service running on it.

Let's say nmap returns the following output:

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
9000/tcp open  http    nginx 1.14.2 (PHP 7.2.10 FastCGI Process Manager)

```

From this, we know that the server is running FastCGI with PHP 7.2.10.

Next, we search for known vulnerabilities of this specific version. A resource like the National Vulnerability Database can be used for this research. Suppose we find a vulnerability that allows unauthorized file reading due to a misconfiguration.

We then attempt to exploit this vulnerability using a tool like `curl`:

```
curl -H "PHP_AUTH_DIGEST: <?php echo file_get_contents('/etc/passwd'); ?" http://target_server_ip:9000/

```

This command sends a request to the FastCGI server, attempting to read the '/etc/passwd' file, which contains user account details.

If the vulnerability exists and the server responds with the content of the '/etc/passwd' file, we know that the server is indeed vulnerable to this exploit.

Remember, each step in this process should be conducted ethically and only on systems you have explicit permission to test.
