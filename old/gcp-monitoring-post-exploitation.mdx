# GCP - Monitoring Post Exploitation


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Monitoring Post Exploitation refers to the process of observing and managing the activities after a successful cyber attack or intrusion has been carried out on a GCP infrastructure. Post exploitation activities might include data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or establishing persistent access.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Monitoring Post Exploitation is crucial in cybersecurity because it helps to understand the depth and impact of a security breach. By monitoring the attacker's activities, organizations can gain insights into the attacker's goals and strategies, and take appropriate measures to mitigate damage. This is particularly relevant for GCP users, as Cloud infrastructures are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals due to the rich data they hold.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Leveraging GCP's built-in monitoring tools, such as Stackdriver, can provide comprehensive visibility into your cloud resources and applications. Additionally, implementing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and setting up alert mechanisms can help detect any unusual activities in real-time. Regular audits of access logs and network traffic can also aid in identifying any potential security threats.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The practice of Monitoring Post Exploitation in GCP started gaining traction with the rise in cloud technology adoption and the corresponding increase in cyber threats targeting cloud infrastructures. It has become a standard part of incident response and threat hunting processes in cybersecurity.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Post exploitation activities are those carried out by an attacker after they've successfully breached a system. In a GCP environment, this might involve gaining access to sensitive data stored in Cloud Storage, escalating privileges to gain control over Compute Engine instances, or establishing a foothold in the environment for future attacks. Monitoring these activities involves using tools such as Google's Stackdriver, which provides logging, monitoring, and alerting services. It allows you to collect logs from your cloud resources, understand the performance of your applications, and setup alerts based on specific conditions. Additionally, using intrusion detection systems (IDS) can help identify malicious activities by monitoring network traffic for signs of attacks. Regular auditing of access logs and network traffic can also provide insights into the attacker's actions after a breach, helping to mitigate damage and prevent future attacks.
