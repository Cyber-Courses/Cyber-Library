# GCP - Logging Post Exploitation


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> GCP Logging Post Exploitation is a technique used by cyber attackers to extract valuable data from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) logs. These logs contain valuable information such as event data, system operations, and user activities which can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or compromise a system.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding GCP Logging Post Exploitation is crucial as it helps in identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities in cloud systems. Cyber attackers exploit weak or misconfigured logging controls to gain access to sensitive data. Therefore, learning about these techniques can help in strengthening system security and preventing data breaches.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> GCP Logging Post Exploitation can be implemented by first having access to the GCP environment either through compromised credentials or vulnerabilities. Then, the attacker can access the logs and extract valuable data. To mitigate this, ensure that you have strong access controls, regularly monitor and analyze your logs, and implement proper security measures.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> GCP Logging Post Exploitation practices started becoming prevalent with the advent and widespread adoption of cloud computing. As more organizations move their operations to the cloud, the risks associated with GCP Logging Post Exploitation have also increased.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

GCP Logging Post Exploitation involves exploiting the log data stored in Google Cloud Platform. This can be done through various methods such as log injection, log manipulation, and log analysis. Log injection involves inserting malicious code or data into logs, while log manipulation involves altering the existing log data. On the other hand, log analysis involves studying the log data to extract valuable information. The key to preventing GCP Logging Post Exploitation lies in proper log management, regular monitoring, and strong access controls.
