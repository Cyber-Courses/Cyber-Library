# 25,465,587 - Pentesting SMTP/s


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Pentesting SMTP/s or the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol/s is a cybersecurity measure that tests the robustness of the SMTP server. This is achieved by simulating attacks on the server to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious entities.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> SMTP servers are an integral part of the email communication system on the internet. They are responsible for the delivery of email messages from a source address to a destination address. If compromised, an attacker can intercept, modify, or even block email communications. This can lead to data breaches, loss of sensitive information and damage to a company's reputation. Therefore, it's crucial to periodically conduct pentesting of SMTP servers to ensure their security.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To perform pentesting on SMTP servers, one can use various tools such as SMTP-user-enum, a tool for enumerating users on SMTP servers, and SWAKS, a flexible tool for SMTP server testing. The process involves scanning the server for open ports, testing for SMTP relay configuration, checking for email spoofing, and testing the strength of user credentials. It's important to remember that pentesting should be performed in a controlled environment and with appropriate permissions to prevent any unintended consequences.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> SMTP pentesting should be done periodically and especially when there are major changes in the server configuration, new patches or updates are applied, or when a security breach is suspected.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

SMTP, or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is an internet standard used to transmit emails over IP networks. The SMTP servers operate on a "push model", where they send messages from the sender to the receiver.

Pentesting, short for penetration testing, is a cybersecurity strategy used to identify vulnerabilities in a system, in this case, SMTP servers. During SMTP pentesting, the tester aims to exploit potential vulnerabilities such as open relays and user enumeration.

Open relays are SMTP servers configured to allow anyone on the internet to send email through them. While this might be useful in some scenarios, it can be exploited by spammers to send unsolicited emails, thereby masking their identities.

User enumeration is a process where an attacker gains a list of valid usernames on a system. In the case of SMTP servers, this could potentially reveal sensitive user information.

The pentesting process can be automated using tools like SMTP-user-enum, which is specifically designed for enumerating users on SMTP servers, and SWAKS, a flexible tool used for SMTP server testing. These tools help to streamline the process and make it easier to identify security gaps.

After the pentesting process, it's crucial to address any identified vulnerabilities promptly. This could involve applying patches or updates, or reconfiguring the server's settings to enhance its security. Regularly conducting SMTP pentesting and taking swift action to rectify any security issues found is a critical part of maintaining the security and integrity of an SMTP server.

For example, let's consider a scenario where we want to perform pentesting on an SMTP server using the tool SWAKS.

1. **Installation**: Firstly, we need to install SWAKS. If we're using a Debian-based system, the command would be `sudo apt-get install swaks`.
2. **SMTP Server Testing**: Next, we can test the SMTP server by sending a test email. The command would look like this: `swaks --to test@example.com --from sender@example.com --server smtp.example.com`. Here, `test@example.com` is the recipient's email, `sender@example.com` is the sender's email, and `smtp.example.com` is the SMTP server.
3. **Analyzing Output**: If the server is working correctly, SWAKS will return an output that includes the conversation it had with the mail server. It will show each command it sent and the response it received, including the final `250 OK` message from the server, indicating that the email was accepted for delivery.
4. **Identifying Vulnerabilities**: To identify potential vulnerabilities like open relays, we can try to send an email without authentication. If the server allows it, that's a security risk. The command would be the same as above, but without any authentication: `swaks --to test@example.com --from sender@example.com --server smtp.example.com`.
5. **Remediation**: If we identify vulnerabilities, the next step is to resolve them. For example, if we found that the server has an open relay, we need to reconfigure the server to require authentication.

This is a basic example of how SMTP pentesting can be performed. In a real-world scenario, the process might involve additional steps and tests, such as user enumeration, checking for TLS encryption, and more. Each step helps to ensure the robustness and security of the SMTP server.
