# GCP - Cloud Functions Persistence


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Google Cloud Functions Persistence refers to the ability of Google Cloud Functions to maintain state across multiple invocations. This is a key feature in serverless architecture, where code functions are expected to be stateless and ephemeral, meaning they do not retain data from one invocation to the next. However, by using various techniques and services, such as Google Cloud Storage or Cloud Firestore, developers can achieve persistence in their Cloud Functions.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding GCP Cloud Functions Persistence is important as it allows developers to create more versatile and powerful applications. With persistence, the state of a function can be maintained across different invocations, meaning data can be stored and retrieved as needed. This is crucial in applications that require data consistency and durability, such as e-commerce platforms, content management systems, or any application that needs to maintain user sessions. As such, mastering persistence in Cloud Functions can greatly enhance the functionality of cloud applications.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To implement persistence in Google Cloud Functions, developers can use Google Cloud Storage or Cloud Firestore. With Cloud Storage, a function can write data to a bucket, and then read this data in subsequent invocations. With Cloud Firestore, a function can write data to a document in a Firestore database, and then read this data in subsequent invocations. Both of these methods provide a way to maintain state across multiple function invocations.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Google Cloud Functions was launched in 2016, but the need for function persistence has been around since the inception of serverless computing. As such, developers have been using various techniques to achieve persistence in Cloud Functions since the early days of the service.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Under the hood, Google Cloud Functions Persistence relies on the use of external storage services, such as Google Cloud Storage or Cloud Firestore. When a function is invoked, it can write data to these services. Then, in subsequent invocations, the function can read this data, effectively maintaining its state across invocations. This is in contrast to traditional serverless architecture, where functions are stateless and do not maintain data across invocations. However, by leveraging these external storage services, developers can achieve persistence in their Cloud Functions, thus enhancing the versatility and power of their applications.
