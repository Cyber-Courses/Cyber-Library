# Pentesting IPv6


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Pentesting IPv6 refers to the practice of assessing the security of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) network infrastructures through simulated cyber-attacks. The aim is to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors and to improve the security measures in place.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> The importance of pentesting IPv6 arises from the growing adoption of IPv6 due to the depletion of IPv4 addresses. This newer version of IP not only offers an almost unlimited number of addresses but also differs in structure and operation from its predecessor. Therefore, it opens up new potential vulnerabilities that need to be identified and addressed. With cyber threats becoming increasingly sophisticated, it is important for organizations to ensure their IPv6 networks are secure.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Pentesting IPv6 involves a series of steps. First, the pentester needs to gather information about the target network, such as the IPv6 address space in use. Then, they need to scan the network to identify active hosts and open ports. Following that, they need to conduct vulnerability assessment to identify potential weaknesses. Finally, they can perform penetration tests to see if these vulnerabilities can be exploited. Throughout the process, they need to document their findings and provide recommendations for improving security. It's important to note that pentesting should only be performed by authorized individuals or as part of a sanctioned security assessment.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Pentesting IPv6 became more significant around the mid-2000s with the gradual exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and the consequent adoption of IPv6. Since then, it has become a crucial part of network security assessments, particularly for large organizations and network service providers.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

IPv6 introduces new protocols, features, and configurations that can present new security challenges. For example, it has a more complex header structure and the use of ICMPv6 for neighbor discovery, both of which can be leveraged for attacks. Also, the vast address space can make it harder to locate specific devices or to conduct traditional scanning activities. Pentesting can help uncover potential security issues such as misconfigurations, unsecured devices, and vulnerabilities in the protocols or the network infrastructure. It involves techniques like network enumeration, vulnerability scanning, packet sniffing, and actual penetration attempts. Successful pentests provide valuable insights into the network's security posture and help identify areas for improvement.

## Detailed Steps and Examples

### 1. Information Gathering

The first step in pentesting IPv6 is gathering information about the target network. This includes identifying the IPv6 address space in use, the types of devices on the network, and the services running on those devices.

**Example:**
Use the `nmap` tool with the `-6` option to scan for IPv6 addresses.

```bash
nmap -6 -sP 2001:db8::/32

```

This command will perform a ping scan on the specified IPv6 address range (`2001:db8::/32`), identifying which devices are active.

### 2. Network Enumeration

Network enumeration involves identifying active hosts, open ports, and running services. This step helps in understanding the network layout and discovering potential entry points.

**Example:**
Use `nmap` to scan for open ports and services on an identified IPv6 address.

```bash
nmap -6 -sT 2001:db8::1

```

This command performs a TCP connect scan on the IPv6 address `2001:db8::1`, identifying open ports and services.

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment

Once the network is mapped out, the next step is to assess the vulnerabilities of the identified hosts and services. This involves scanning for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

**Example:**
Use `OpenVAS` to perform a vulnerability scan.

```bash
openvas-start

```

Configure the scan using the web interface, specifying the target IPv6 address range and the types of vulnerabilities to look for.

### 4. Exploitation

After identifying vulnerabilities, the next step is to attempt to exploit them to gain unauthorized access or control over the target systems. This should be done with caution and only on authorized networks.

**Example:**
Use `Metasploit` to exploit a vulnerability.

```bash
msfconsole

```

Search for an exploit module:

```bash
search ms08-067

```

Select and configure the exploit:

```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
set RHOST 2001:db8::1
run

```

### 5. Documentation and Reporting

Throughout the pentesting process, it's essential to document findings and provide detailed reports. The report should include identified vulnerabilities, exploitation attempts, and recommendations for improving security.

**Example:**
Create a detailed report using a template that includes sections for an executive summary, detailed findings, and remediation steps.

### Real-World Example

Consider a scenario where a pentester is tasked with assessing the security of a corporate IPv6 network. The network uses the address range `2001:db8::/32`.

1. **Information Gathering:**
    - The pentester uses `nmap` to identify active hosts within the address range.
    - The scan reveals several active devices, including servers and workstations.
2. **Network Enumeration:**
    - The pentester performs further scans to identify open ports and running services on these devices.
    - The scans reveal that some servers are running outdated versions of web services and databases.
3. **Vulnerability Assessment:**
    - Using `OpenVAS`, the pentester discovers several known vulnerabilities in the outdated services, including an SQL injection vulnerability in a web application.
4. **Exploitation:**
    - The pentester uses `Metasploit` to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database.
5. **Documentation and Reporting:**
    - The pentester documents each step, including the tools used, commands executed, and results obtained.
    - A detailed report is created, highlighting the vulnerabilities found and providing recommendations for patching and securing the network.

By following these steps, the pentester provides valuable insights into the security posture of the IPv6 network, helping the organization to identify and address potential threats.
