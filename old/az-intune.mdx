### 👀 What ?

Azure Intune, also known as Microsoft Intune, is a cloud-based service that focuses on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM). It allows organizations to provide their employees with access to corporate applications, data, and resources from virtually anywhere on almost any device, while helping to keep corporate information secure.


### 🧐 Why ?

In the modern world, where employees often work remotely and use a variety of devices, maintaining control over corporate data is a significant challenge. Azure Intune aims to address this issue by providing a way to manage and secure corporate data and applications on employees' devices without intruding on their personal data. It is important because it enhances data security, ensures compliance, and increases productivity by enabling safe mobile work environment.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use Azure Intune, you first need to subscribe to the service, either standalone or as part of Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility + Security Suite. You then need to register your devices with Intune. After that, you can use the Intune console to manage your organization's devices and apps. For example, you can enforce device and app security policies, deploy software and apps, and remote wipe a device if it's lost or stolen.


### ⏳ When ?

Microsoft Intune was first released in 2011. It has since become a key component of Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility + Security Suite, which was launched in 2016.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, Azure Intune works by communicating with your devices via a client application that's installed on the device. It uses the OMA-DM (Open Mobile Alliance Device Management) protocol for communication. When a policy or app is deployed from Intune, it's sent to the device via push notification. The device then checks in with Intune to get the details and applies the policy or app. Intune supports a variety of device types, including Windows, iOS, Android, and MacOS. It can manage devices at both the device level (MDM) and the app level (MAM).
