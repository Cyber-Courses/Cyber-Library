# GCP - App Engine Unauthenticated Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP (Google Cloud Platform) App Engine Unauthenticated Enum is a security vulnerability that allows unauthorized enumerations to be made on Google's App Engine. This enumeration can disclose sensitive information about the applications running on the App Engine, including their configurations and data.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding this vulnerability is crucial for both developers and users of applications running on Google's App Engine. For developers, it highlights the importance of implementing proper authentication and access controls on their applications. For users, it underscores the potential risks of using applications that do not have these security measures in place. Without proper safeguards, sensitive information could be exposed to malicious actors, leading to data breaches and other security incidents.


### ⛏️ How ?

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would simply need to make unauthenticated requests to the App Engine. The responses to these requests could reveal information about the applications running on the engine. To prevent this vulnerability, developers should ensure that all requests to their applications are authenticated and that access controls are strictly enforced. This can be achieved through the use of authentication protocols and access control lists (ACLs).


### ⏳ When ?

This vulnerability has been a known issue in GCP App Engine since its early stages of development. However, it continues to be a concern due to the ongoing prevalence of unauthenticated and improperly controlled requests.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At the heart of this vulnerability is the lack of proper authentication and access controls on requests made to the App Engine. When a request is made, the engine should verify the identity of the requester and determine if they have the necessary permissions to access the requested information. If these checks are not in place or are improperly implemented, the engine could disclose sensitive information. This could include details about the applications running on the engine, such as their configurations, data, and possibly even user information. To prevent this vulnerability, developers need to ensure that their applications implement robust authentication and access controls. This includes using secure authentication protocols, implementing access control lists (ACLs), and regularly reviewing and updating these controls as necessary.
