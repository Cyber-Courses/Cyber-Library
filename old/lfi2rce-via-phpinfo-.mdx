# LFI2RCE via phpinfo()


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution (LFI2RCE) via phpinfo() is a technique used to exploit a vulnerability in PHP scripts. This vulnerability occurs when an application uses user-supplied input without properly validating it, allowing an attacker to include files from local or remote servers.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding LFI2RCE via phpinfo() is crucial, particularly for web developers and cybersecurity professionals. This is because it is a common attack vector used to exploit PHP applications. By gaining an in-depth understanding of this technique, one can develop more secure PHP applications and implement effective security measures.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To exploit LFI2RCE via phpinfo(), an attacker first identifies a PHP script that is vulnerable to file inclusion. The attacker then attempts to inject malicious code or include a file from a remote server. If successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control over it.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> LFI2RCE via phpinfo() has been a known attack vector since the early days of PHP. It continues to be used today due to the prevalence of insecure PHP scripts.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

LFI2RCE via phpinfo() exploits the fact that PHP's 'phpinfo()' function outputs information about the PHP environment, including the values of PHP variables. If the output of 'phpinfo()' is accessible to an attacker, and the application uses the 'include()' or 'require()' functions with user-supplied input, an attacker can manipulate the input to include a file of their choosing. This could be a file on the local server, or a file on a remote server if the PHP configuration allows for remote file inclusion (RFI). If the included file contains PHP code, this code will be executed by the server. This can lead to a complete server takeover if the executed code gives the attacker a shell or other means of executing further commands.
