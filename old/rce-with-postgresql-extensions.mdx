# RCE with PostgreSQL Extensions


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

RCE with PostgreSQL Extensions is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a server where the PostgreSQL database engine is running. PostgreSQL extensions are pieces of software that add functionality to the base PostgreSQL system, but they can be misused to run malicious code.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding this concept is crucial for both developers and cybersecurity professionals. Developers need to be aware of this vulnerability to avoid introducing it into their software, while cybersecurity professionals need to understand it to defend systems against it. Moreover, as PostgreSQL is widely used in many organizations, the potential impact of this vulnerability is high.


### ⛏️ How ?

To implement RCE with PostgreSQL Extensions, an attacker needs to have certain privileges, such as the ability to create new functions or to load extensions. They can then use these privileges to create a malicious function that executes system commands. This function can be triggered either directly, if the attacker has sufficient permissions, or indirectly, by tricking a user with sufficient permissions into running it.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of PostgreSQL Extensions for RCE has been known since the early 2000s, but it remains a relevant threat due to the ongoing use of PostgreSQL and the complexity of securing it properly.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

PostgreSQL allows users to extend its functionality through the use of extensions, which are pieces of software that can be loaded into the database. However, some extensions can be used to execute system commands, leading to a potential RCE vulnerability. The attacker needs to have the ability to load extensions, which usually requires superuser or database owner privileges. Once such an extension is loaded, it can be used to create a new database function that executes arbitrary system commands. This function can then be called to execute these commands, leading to RCE.
