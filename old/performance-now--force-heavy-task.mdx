# performance.now + Force heavy task


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Performance.now is a method available in the window.performance object of the web APIs provided by the browsers. It offers high resolution timestamps, which makes it very useful for measuring the time taken by a particular operation in a web application. Force heavy task, on the other hand, is a technique used to create tasks that require significant computational resources. This technique is often used in benchmarking and stress testing scenarios.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Performance.now is important because it allows developers to accurately measure the performance of their code, helping them identify bottlenecks and optimize their applications. The precision of Performance.now is particularly useful in scenarios where micro-optimizations matter. Force heavy task is important for testing how a system performs under heavy load, which can be crucial for ensuring that the system is robust and can handle high demand.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To use Performance.now, simply call the method and it will return the current timestamp in milliseconds, with microsecond precision. For example: `var start = performance.now(); doSomething(); var end = performance.now(); console.log('This operation took ' + (end - start) + ' milliseconds.');` To create a force heavy task, you would typically write a function that performs a computationally intensive operation, such as a large number of mathematical calculations.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Performance.now and the concept of force heavy tasks have been used since the early days of JavaScript and web development. However, their usage has become more prevalent with the increasing complexity of web applications and the need to optimize their performance.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Performance.now works by accessing the high resolution clock of the browser, which is not affected by system clock skew or adjustments. The timestamp it returns is a DOMHighResTimeStamp, which represents the number of milliseconds elapsed since a certain reference time (typically the time at which the document was created). Force heavy task involves creating a task that requires a large amount of CPU time. This can be done in JavaScript by creating a loop that performs a large number of calculations, or by calling a computationally intensive function. The key is to create a task that is heavy enough to put significant load on the system, but not so heavy that it causes the system to become unresponsive or crash.
