# Az - Lateral Movement (Cloud - On-Prem)


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Az - Lateral Movement refers to the technique of moving across a network, from one system to another, in search of valuable data. The term 'Cloud - On-Prem' refers to a hybrid IT deployment model where an organization provides and manages some resources in-house (on-premises) and uses cloud-based services for others.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding Az - Lateral Movement (Cloud - On-Prem) is crucial as it's a common tactic used by attackers to explore and exploit vulnerabilities within a network. It allows them to move stealthily and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.


### ⛏️ How ?

Az - Lateral Movement can be combated by implementing robust security measures such as network segmentation, least privilege access, regular system updates and security audits. Anomaly detection systems can also be used to identify unusual activity indicative of lateral movement.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of Az - Lateral Movement (Cloud - On-Prem) has become more prevalent with the rise in cyber attacks targeting hybrid IT environments.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

In the context of Azure (Az), lateral movement signifies the process of navigating across a network after gaining initial access usually via compromised endpoints. While 'On-Prem' signifies the traditional IT infrastructure within an organization’s premises, 'Cloud' refers to the resources that are delivered and consumed on-demand via the internet from a cloud provider.
