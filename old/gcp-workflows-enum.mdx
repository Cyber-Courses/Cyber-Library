# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Workflows Enum works by interacting with the GCP API to retrieve information about workflows in a project. It uses the 'list' method of the Workflows API to get a list of all workflows, and the 'describe' method to get detailed information about a specific workflow. This tool is built into the gcloud command-line tool, so you don't need to install anything extra to use it.
