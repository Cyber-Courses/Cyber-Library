# Baseline


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Baseline is a standard or reference point used in the fields of project management, business analysis, and software development, among others. It represents a static snapshot of a project plan at a particular point in time which serves as a benchmark against which the project's progress can be measured and evaluated. In other words, it is the point of comparison for the current project status.


### 🧐 Why ?

Baselines are critical for effective project management and control. They allow for the comparison of actual versus planned performance, helping to identify deviations and take necessary corrective actions. Without a baseline, it would be difficult to measure progress and performance, control changes, and manage stakeholder expectations. Hence, understanding the concept of baselines is crucial for anyone involved in project management or related fields.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use or implement a baseline, start by creating a detailed project plan that includes elements such as project scope, schedule, and cost. Once the plan is finalized and approved by the relevant stakeholders, take a snapshot of the plan to create the baseline. Going forward, use this baseline to track and measure the project's performance. If there are any significant changes to the project plan, you may need to create a new baseline. It's important to remember that baselines should only be changed with proper justification and approval.


### ⏳ When ?

The concept of baselines has been in use in project management and related fields for many years. It is a standard practice in various project management methodologies, including the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) by the Project Management Institute (PMI).


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

A baseline in project management is a critical tool utilized for comparison and evaluation of a project's progress. It consists of three main components: scope baseline, schedule baseline, and cost baseline.

The scope baseline is a detailed description of what the project will deliver. It includes the project scope statement, which outlines the project's purpose, objectives, and deliverables. The work breakdown structure (WBS), another part of the scope baseline, is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team. The WBS dictionary provides detailed information about each component in the WBS, including tasks, deliverables, and necessary resources.

The schedule baseline is an approved version of the project schedule. It includes all project tasks, their durations, dependencies, and milestones. It serves as a reference point to monitor the project's time management, allowing project managers to identify any delays or schedule overruns.

The cost baseline, on the other hand, is a time-phased budget, or cost projection, approved and used as a starting point to measure the financial performance of the project. It helps identify any cost overruns and manage project finances effectively.

Together, these three baselines form the performance measurement baseline (PMB), a comprehensive tool used to measure, monitor, and control the overall performance of the project. Any deviation from the PMB can trigger a change request, and significant changes may require the creation of a new baseline.

In the context of software development, a baseline refers to a fixed point in the software development process. It could be a set version of a software product that serves as a starting point for future development. It allows developers to measure progress, control changes, manage versions, and ensure consistency and stability of the software product.
