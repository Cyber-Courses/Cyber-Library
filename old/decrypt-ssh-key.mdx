# Decrypt ssh key


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication. An SSH key is a pair of cryptographic keys which can be used to authenticate a client to a server without the use of a password. Decrypting an SSH key refers to the process of converting encrypted data (the SSH key) into a format that is readable and usable.


### 🧐 Why ?

Decrypting an SSH key is a critical part of maintaining secure communications in a network. It is used to authenticate a client to a server, ensuring that the client is who they claim to be. Without it, the data transmitted between the client and server could be intercepted and modified by malicious parties.


### ⛏️ How ?

To decrypt an SSH key, you will first need to have the private key and the passphrase used to encrypt it. The process can be done using SSH-keygen, a tool provided by OpenSSH. Here is a basic step by step guide: 1. Open a terminal. 2. Type the command 'ssh-keygen -p' and press Enter. 3. At the prompt, type the file path of your private key and press Enter. 4. At the next prompt, type your old passphrase and press Enter. 5. At the final prompt, type your new passphrase and press Enter.


### ⏳ When ?

SSH was introduced in 1995 as a secure replacement for the telnet protocol, which transmits communication in plain text. The need to decrypt SSH keys arises when you need to authenticate a client to a server, or when you need to change the passphrase of an encrypted private key.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

SSH keys, which are fundamental for secure communication in networks, are created using a mathematical algorithm that generates a pair of long character strings - a private key and a public key. The private key is closely guarded by the user, while the public key is shared openly.

When an SSH key is used to authenticate a client to a server, the server encrypts a random number with the client's public key and sends it to the client. The client then decrypts the number using their private key and sends it back to the server. If the number matches the original, the server validates that the client possesses the correct private key and grants authentication.

The decryption process of an SSH key allows it to be converted from its encrypted state into a format that is readable and usable. To decrypt an SSH key, one must possess both the private key and the passphrase used to encrypt it. The process can be carried out using SSH-keygen, a tool provided by OpenSSH.

The steps are as follows:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Type the command 'ssh-keygen -p' and press Enter.
3. At the prompt, type the file path of your private key and press Enter.
4. At the next prompt, type your old passphrase and press Enter.
5. At the final prompt, type your new passphrase and press Enter.

The need for decrypting SSH keys arises when you need to authenticate a client to a server or when you need to change the passphrase of an encrypted private key. It's a crucial aspect of maintaining secure communications in a network, ensuring client-server data isn't intercepted or tampered with by malicious parties.

Let's walk through an example of how to decrypt an SSH key using a mock scenario for educational purposes:

Scenario: You have an SSH private key named `id_rsa` located in the `.ssh` directory of your home folder, and you want to change its passphrase.

1. **Open a terminal**
    - On Windows, press `Win+R`, type `cmd`, and hit enter.
    - On Mac or Linux, use the Terminal app or an equivalent console.
2. **Navigate to the `.ssh` directory**
    
    ```
    cd ~/.ssh
    
    ```
    
3. **Start the SSH key decryption process using SSH-keygen**
    
    ```
    ssh-keygen -p
    
    ```
    
    This command initiates the process to change your SSH key passphrase.
    
4. **Enter the file path of the private key**
    
    ```
    Enter file in which the key is (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa):
    
    ```
    
    You can either press enter to accept the default location or type the full path to your key file if it's located elsewhere.
    
5. **Enter your old passphrase**
    
    ```
    Enter old passphrase:
    
    ```
    
    Type your current passphrase and press enter. For security reasons, the characters will not display as you type.
    
6. **Enter your new passphrase**
    
    ```
    Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    
    ```
    
    Type your new passphrase and press enter. Again, the characters will not display.
    
7. **Confirm your new passphrase**
    
    ```
    Enter same passphrase again:
    
    ```
    
    Type your new passphrase again and press enter. If the two entries match, SSH-keygen will re-encrypt your key with the new passphrase, and you'll see a confirmation message like this:
    
    ```
    Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.
    
    ```
    

Remember, this is a crucial step in maintaining secure communications in a network, ensuring that client-server data isn't intercepted or tampered with by malicious parties.
