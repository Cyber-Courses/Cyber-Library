### 👀 What ?

Azure Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) is a feature provided by Microsoft Azure, which simplifies the login process for end users. With this feature, users can access Azure AD resources without having to re-enter their credentials.


### 🧐 Why ?

Seamless SSO is important as it improves the user experience by simplifying the login process, thereby reducing the time and effort required to access resources. Additionally, it enhances security by minimizing the risk of password-related attacks.


### ⛏️ How ?

To implement Azure Seamless SSO, follow these steps: 1. Enable the feature in Azure AD Connect. 2. Verify the feature is enabled via PowerShell. 3. Roll out the feature to client computers. 4. Test the feature to ensure it's working properly.


### ⏳ When ?

Azure Seamless SSO was introduced by Microsoft as part of Azure AD Connect in 2017. Since then, it has become a widely used feature for businesses that rely on Azure for their cloud services.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

Azure Seamless SSO works by securely storing a Kerberos decryption key in Azure AD. When a user signs into a domain-joined device, a Kerberos ticket is sent to Azure AD, which then decrypts the ticket using the stored key to verify the user's identity. This process occurs behind the scenes, providing a seamless login experience for the user.
