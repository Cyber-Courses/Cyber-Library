# Web Vulnerabilities Methodology


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Web vulnerabilities methodology is a systematic approach to identify, analyze, and address security vulnerabilities in web applications.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding web vulnerabilities is critical to maintaining the security of web applications. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or steal sensitive data. Therefore, a robust methodology to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities is essential for any organization that relies on web applications for its operations.


### ⛏️ How ?

A typical web vulnerabilities methodology involves several steps. First, the system's components and architecture are analyzed to understand potential attack vectors. This is followed by a vulnerability assessment, where tools and techniques are used to identify security flaws. Once vulnerabilities are identified, they are analyzed to understand their impact and the risk they pose. Mitigation strategies are then developed and implemented. Finally, the system is re-assessed to ensure the vulnerabilities have been effectively mitigated.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of web vulnerabilities methodology became more prevalent with the rise of the internet and web applications in the late 20th century. As web applications became more complex and critical to business operations, the need for a systematic approach to identify and address vulnerabilities became apparent.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Web vulnerabilities methodology involves several key concepts. The first is the concept of attack vectors, which are the paths or means by which an attacker can gain access to a computer or network server. The second key concept is vulnerabilities, which are weaknesses that can be exploited by an attacker. The third key concept is risk, which is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. These three concepts form the basis of any web vulnerabilities methodology and are used to guide the process of identifying, analyzing, and addressing security vulnerabilities.
