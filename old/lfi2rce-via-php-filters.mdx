# LFI2RCE via PHP Filters


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution (LFI2RCE) via PHP Filters is a technique used by cyber attackers to execute arbitrary code on a target system by exploiting a vulnerable PHP application.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding LFI2RCE via PHP Filters is crucial for developers and cybersecurity professionals alike, as it reveals potential vulnerabilities in PHP applications that could be exploited by cyber attackers. By learning about this topic, readers can better protect their PHP applications from such attacks.


### ⛏️ How ?

LFI2RCE via PHP Filters can be implemented by first identifying a potential LFI vulnerability within a PHP application. Once identified, an attacker can use PHP filters to manipulate the LFI vulnerability into executing arbitrary code.


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of exploiting LFI vulnerabilities via PHP Filters has been prevalent in the cybersecurity field for years. However, with the growing popularity of PHP for web development, the significance and potential impact of such exploits have also increased.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

The LFI2RCE via PHP Filters technique involves the use of PHP's built-in filters, which allow for data manipulation in PHP applications. An attacker could use a PHP filter to convert their malicious code into a format that could be interpreted and executed by the target system. This is achieved by manipulating the Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, which allows an attacker to include a local file from the server side, into executing the attacker's code. This could potentially lead to a full system takeover if the code is executed with sufficient privileges.
