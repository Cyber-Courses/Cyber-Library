# GCP - Secrets Manager Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Secrets Manager Enum is a service that helps handle, manage and access sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, certificates, etc. in a centralized, secure and convenient manner. It provides a unified and consistent view of all secrets across an organization.


### 🧐 Why ?

The importance of Secrets Manager Enum can be seen in its ability to address the challenges of managing sensitive data in an environment where security is paramount. Instead of having secrets scattered across different services or hard-coded into applications, Secrets Manager Enum provides a centralized, auditable, and secure solution. This is important for our readers who are involved in managing sensitive data and want to ensure that they are following best security practices.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use GCP's Secrets Manager Enum, you first need to create a secret which can be done using the GCP Console, the command-line interface, or the Secrets Manager API. After creating a secret, you can add versions to it. Each version is a distinct set of secret data. You can access the secret data by calling the access method on the version of the secret you want to access. You can also set access control policies to define who can access your secrets.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of Secrets Manager Enum became more prevalent as organizations began to move towards cloud services. It is particularly useful in a microservices architecture where secrets need to be shared across different services. The exact timeline for when it was first implemented is not readily available.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At the heart of Secrets Manager Enum is the concept of a 'Secret' which is a logical container of secret versions. The 'Secret Version' is a resource which holds secret data. This data is encrypted with a key that is managed by Google, ensuring the security of the secret data. The resource name of the secret version is used to access the secret data. The Access Control List (ACL) is used to determine who can access the secret data. The ACL is attached to the secret, and it defines the identities (like service accounts) that can access the secret data.
