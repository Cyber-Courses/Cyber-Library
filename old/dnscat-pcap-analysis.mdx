# DNSCat pcap analysis


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

> DNSCat is a tool that allows users to create an encrypted command and control (C2) channel over the Domain Name System (DNS). A pcap, short for packet capture, is a file format used to store network traffic data. DNSCat pcap analysis, therefore, involves examining network traffic data captured during a DNSCat session to investigate potentially malicious activity or to troubleshoot network issues.
> 

### 🧐 Why ?

> Understanding DNSCat pcap analysis is vital because DNS is a common protocol that is allowed through firewalls, making it an attractive method for exfiltrating data or controlling compromised systems covertly. Detecting malicious DNS traffic can be challenging given the vast amount of legitimate DNS traffic on a network. Therefore, learning how to analyze DNSCat pcap files can help network administrators and security professionals detect and understand malicious activity hidden in DNS traffic.
> 

### ⛏️ How ?

> To analyze a DNSCat pcap file, you can use a tool like Wireshark, a popular network protocol analyzer. After loading the pcap file into Wireshark, you can filter for DNS traffic and then analyze the various DNS queries and responses. Look for unusual patterns, such as an excessive number of DNS requests, unusually long domain names, or strange subdomains, as these can be signs of DNS tunneling. You can also use the 'Follow TCP Stream' function in Wireshark to examine the data being sent and received in each DNS session.
> 

### ⏳ When ?

> The use of DNS for command and control activities has been prevalent for several years, and tools like DNSCat have been around since the early 2010s. DNSCat pcap analysis is a continually relevant skill as long as DNS remains a popular protocol for data exfiltration and command and control activities.

DNSCat is a tool that allows users to create an encrypted command and control (C2) channel over the Domain Name System (DNS). A pcap, short for packet capture, is a file format used to store network traffic data. DNSCat pcap analysis involves examining network traffic data captured during a DNSCat session to investigate potentially malicious activity or to troubleshoot network issues. Understanding DNSCat pcap analysis is vital because DNS is a common protocol that is allowed through firewalls, making it an attractive method for exfiltrating data or controlling compromised systems covertly. Detecting malicious DNS traffic can be challenging given the vast amount of legitimate DNS traffic on a network. Therefore, learning how to analyze DNSCat pcap files can help network administrators and security professionals detect and understand malicious activity hidden in DNS traffic.

## Detailed Explanation and Examples

### How DNSCat Works

DNSCat works by sending DNS queries from a client to a server. The server then responds with DNS responses containing the command or data. This interaction is captured in a pcap file, which stores all the packet data exchanged during the session. By analyzing the DNS queries and responses in the pcap file, you can uncover the commands sent and the data received. The encryption used by DNSCat can make this analysis more challenging, as the data is not in plaintext. However, if you have access to the encryption key used in the session, you can decrypt the data for analysis.

### Example Scenario

### Step 1: Capturing DNSCat Traffic

First, we'll simulate a DNSCat session to create a pcap file. For educational purposes, we'll assume that we have both the DNSCat client and server set up in our environment.

1. On the server, start the DNSCat server:
    
    ```
    dnscat2-server.rb --secret=supersecretkey
    
    ```
    
2. On the client, start the DNSCat client and connect to the server:
    
    ```
    dnscat2 --dns server=example.com
    
    ```
    
3. Use a packet capture tool like `tcpdump` to capture the traffic:
    
    ```
    tcpdump -i eth0 -w dnscat-traffic.pcap port 53
    
    ```
    

This will generate a pcap file named `dnscat-traffic.pcap` containing the DNS traffic between the client and server.

### Step 2: Analyzing the pcap File with Wireshark

1. Open Wireshark and load the pcap file:
    
    ```
    wireshark dnscat-traffic.pcap
    
    ```
    
2. Apply a DNS filter to isolate DNS traffic:
    
    ```
    dns
    
    ```
    
3. Inspect the DNS queries and responses. Look for unusual patterns, such as:
    - An excessive number of DNS requests.
    - Unusually long domain names.
    - Strange subdomains that do not seem to belong to legitimate domains.
4. Use the "Follow UDP Stream" function to examine the data:
    - Right-click on a DNS packet.
    - Select "Follow" > "UDP Stream".
5. If you have the encryption key, decrypt the data:
    - Export the stream data to a file.
    - Use a tool like `openssl` to decrypt the data:
        
        ```
        openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in encrypted_data.bin -out decrypted_data.txt -k supersecretkey
        
        ```
        

### Step 3: Interpreting the Results

Analyze the decrypted data to understand the commands and data exchanged during the DNSCat session. Look for:

- Specific commands sent from the client to the server.
- Data exfiltrated from the client to the server.

### Conclusion

DNSCat pcap analysis is a valuable skill for network administrators and security professionals. By understanding how to capture and analyze DNS traffic, you can detect and investigate potentially malicious activities hidden within legitimate DNS traffic. This knowledge can help protect your network from data exfiltration and command and control activities using DNS tunneling.

### Additional Tips

- Regularly update your knowledge of DNS tunneling techniques and tools.
- Use automated analysis tools and scripts to assist in detecting unusual DNS patterns.
- Stay informed about the latest security threats and mitigation strategies related to DNS traffic.

By mastering these techniques, you can enhance your ability to safeguard your network against sophisticated threats that leverage DNS for malicious purposes.
