# GCP - Post Exploitation


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Post Exploitation is a phase in cybersecurity where an attacker, having gained access, manipulates the system to achieve their objectives. This could range from data exfiltration to system control. In the context of GCP, it involves exploiting the cloud infrastructure after a successful intrusion.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding GCP Post Exploitation is crucial because as organizations migrate to cloud platforms like GCP, they become attractive targets for cyber-attacks. Post exploitation actions can lead to severe consequences including data breaches, operational disruptions, and financial losses. Hence, understanding this subject helps in building robust security measures and response strategies.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> GCP Post Exploitation can be implemented using various tools and techniques. This includes privilege escalation to gain administrative access, lateral movement to reach sensitive resources, and persistence to maintain access. To protect against it, organizations can employ measures like the principle of least privilege, multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring of the system.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> GCP Post Exploitation has become increasingly relevant and practiced as organizations started moving to the cloud platforms. The rise in cloud computing over the past decade has made it a key area in cybersecurity.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

In the GCP Post Exploitation phase, attackers use techniques like token impersonation, where they impersonate the token of a high privilege account to execute commands. Another common technique is service account exploitation, where the attacker abuses the permissions of a compromised service account. Defending against these requires a deep understanding of GCP IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles, service accounts, and privileges. Regular audits, strict access controls, and anomaly detection can aid in preventing and detecting post exploitation activities.
