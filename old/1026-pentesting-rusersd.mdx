# 1026 - Pentesting Rusersd


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Rusersd (Remote Users Daemon) is a service that allows us to see who is logged into a Unix or Linux based system. This service can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Understanding 1026 - Pentesting Rusersd is crucial because it is a potential vulnerability that hackers can exploit. By understanding how this service works, we can better secure our systems and protect sensitive information.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To perform a penetration test on Rusersd, you need to have a Unix or Linux based system with the Rusersd service running. You can then use tools like Nmap to scan for open ports and identify the Rusersd service. Once identified, you can use various techniques to exploit the service and gain unauthorized access.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The practice of Pentesting Rusersd started in the late 1990s, when Unix and Linux systems became more prevalent. As these systems became more popular, the need to secure them from potential attacks became more apparent.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Rusersd, or Remote Users Daemon, is a service on Unix and Linux systems that tracks user logins and can be queried to see who is currently logged in. It operates by listening on two ports: UDP port 111 and TCP port 1026. When a user logs into the system, Rusersd is notified and records the user's information, such as username and login timestamp.

This information is accessible to anyone with access to the Rusersd service. While this can be useful for system administrators, it also poses a potential security risk. Attackers can exploit this service to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. By using scanning tools like Nmap, attackers can identify systems with open ports and detect the presence of the Rusersd service.

Once the Rusersd service has been identified, the attacker can employ various techniques to exploit it. For instance, they might send specially crafted packets to the service to trigger a response that reveals user information. Alternatively, they could initiate a brute-force attack to guess user passwords.

To protect against such attacks, system administrators should consider disabling the Rusersd service if it's not necessary, or implementing strict access controls. Regularly updating and patching the system can also help to fix any known vulnerabilities in the service. It's essential to conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing to identify potential security risks and ensure that the system is adequately secured.

Here's an educational example of how an attacker might identify and exploit the Rusersd service:

1. **Scanning for open ports:** The attacker first identifies open ports on the target system. This is typically done using a tool like Nmap. The command might look like this:

```
nmap -sT -p- target_IP

```

This command tells Nmap to perform a TCP connect scan (`-sT`) on all ports (`-p-`) of the target system (`target_IP`).

1. **Identifying the Rusersd service:** If ports 111 and 1026 are open, it's likely that the Rusersd service is running. The attacker would then confirm this using another Nmap command:

```
nmap -sV -p 111,1026 target_IP

```

This command attempts to determine the service/version info (`-sV`) of the specified ports (`-p 111,1026`) on the target system (`target_IP`).

1. **Exploiting the Rusersd service:** Once the service is identified, the attacker might send specially crafted packets to the service to trigger a response. They could use a tool like Netcat for this. For example:

```
echo "crafted_packet" | nc target_IP 1026

```

This command sends the string "crafted_packet" to the target system on port 1026.

1. **Brute-force attack:** Alternatively, an attacker could use a tool like Hydra to initiate a brute-force attack to guess user passwords. For example:

```
hydra -l username -P passwordlist.txt target_IP ssh

```

This command tells Hydra to use the username "username", a password list "passwordlist.txt", on the target system `target_IP` via SSH.

**Note:** This example is for educational purposes only and should not be used for illegal activities. Protecting against such attacks involves disabling unnecessary services, implementing strict access controls, and conducting regular security audits and penetration tests.
