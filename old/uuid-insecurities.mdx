# UUID Insecurities


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems. While the probability of collision is extremely low, there are potential insecurities associated with UUIDs that can pose a threat to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.


### 🧐 Why ?

The importance of understanding UUID insecurities lies in the increasingly digital nature of our world. As UUIDs are commonly used in various systems and applications for identification purposes, any vulnerabilities can potentially lead to unauthorized access, information disclosure, or even attacks. This is why we must understand the underlying principles and potential risks associated with UUIDs.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use UUIDs securely, one should ensure that they are generated in a truly random and non-predictable manner. Additionally, it is important to validate and sanitize any UUID received from untrusted sources. Implementing proper access control measures and encryption can also help in mitigating the risks associated with UUID insecurities.


### ⏳ When ?

UUIDs have been in use since the late 1990s, and their insecurities became more prevalent as their usage spread across various systems and applications.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

UUIDs are represented as 32 hexadecimal digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens. They are usually generated using algorithms that are based on the system’s MAC address, the current time, or a combination of both. The two commonly used methods are UUID1 and UUID4. UUID1 is based on the system's network address and current time, while UUID4 uses random or pseudo-random numbers. The insecurities associated with UUIDs stem from the predictability of UUID1 and the potential for collisions in UUID4. Additionally, UUIDs are often used without proper validation or sanitization, leading to potential injection attacks or information disclosure.
