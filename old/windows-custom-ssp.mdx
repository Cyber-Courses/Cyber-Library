# Windows Custom SSP


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Windows Custom SSP (Security Support Provider) is a mechanism that allows developers to integrate their own security modules into the Windows security infrastructure. It provides a way to use custom authentication methods and protocols within the Windows environment.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding Windows Custom SSP is important because it can be a powerful tool for enhancing the security of a Windows system. However, it can also be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to a system or to perform other malicious activities. Therefore, it's crucial to understand this concept not only for system administrators and developers, but also for security professionals.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To implement a Custom SSP, one needs to create a DLL that implements the necessary SSP functions and then register this DLL with the system. This can be done by adding a new entry to the 'SecurityProviders' key in the registry. However, this should be done with caution, as improper implementation can lead to security vulnerabilities.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Custom SSPs have been a part of the Windows security architecture since the release of Windows 2000. They are particularly relevant today as organizations increasingly seek to enhance their security by implementing custom authentication protocols.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

A Security Support Provider (SSP) in Windows is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that implements various security protocols. Windows has several built-in SSPs, such as Kerberos, NTLM, and Negotiate. However, developers can also create custom SSPs to support their own security protocols or methods. These custom SSPs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process, and can be used for authentication, integrity, and confidentiality operations. Custom SSPs can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as single sign-on (SSO) implementations, custom authentication methods, and so on. However, they should be implemented with care, as they run in a highly privileged context and improper implementation can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.
