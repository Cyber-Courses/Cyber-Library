# Az - Virtual Machines & Network


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Azure Virtual Machines (VM) is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft that allows users to create and manage virtual machines in the Azure environment. Azure network is the underlying infrastructure that supports connectivity between these virtual machines and other resources within Azure.


### 🧐 Why ?

Azure VMs and Network are essential tools for businesses to deploy, scale, and manage applications and services without having to invest in physical hardware. Understanding these tools is crucial for IT professionals and developers working in the cloud environment. They allow for rapid deployment, scalability, and flexibility, which are critical in today's fast-paced digital world.


### ⛏️ How ?

To set up a Virtual Machine in Azure, you would first need to have a Microsoft Azure account. From the Azure portal, you can create a new VM by selecting the 'Virtual machines' service, and then 'Add'. You will be guided through the process, choosing your subscription, resource group, VM name, region, and more. For networking, you will need to set up a Virtual Network (VNet) within Azure. VNets can be configured to allow communication between resources in Azure, with on-premises networks, or with the internet.


### ⏳ When ?

Microsoft Azure was first released in February 2010. The use of Azure VMs and Azure Network has grown exponentially since then, with businesses of all sizes and industries leveraging these tools to host and scale their applications and services in the cloud.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Azure VMs run on the Microsoft Azure Hypervisor for virtualization. Each VM runs its own operating system, and users can choose from a variety of Windows and Linux distributions. VMs can be customized with different numbers of cores, memory, and disk storage based on the requirements of the applications they are running. Azure Network consists of multiple components including Azure Virtual Network (VNet), Network Security Groups (NSGs), Application Security Groups (ASGs), and more. VNet is the fundamental building block for private networks in Azure. NSGs are used to allow or deny traffic to resources within a VNet, while ASGs are used to group VMs and define network security policies based on those groups.
