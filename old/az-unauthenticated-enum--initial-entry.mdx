# Az - Unauthenticated Enum & Initial Entry


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Az Unauthenticated Enum & Initial Entry refers to a cybersecurity practice that involves enumerating or identifying resources within a Microsoft Azure environment without requiring authentication. It's the initial step in penetrating an Azure environment, which can potentially lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding this topic is crucial for both attackers and defenders in the field of cybersecurity. For cyber attackers, it's the initial step in gaining unauthorized access, while for defenders, knowing how it works allows them to secure their Azure environments effectively. In today's digital world, where data breaches are becoming increasingly common, it's essential to understand such attack vectors and how to defend against them.


### ⛏️ How ?

To perform Az Unauthenticated Enum & Initial Entry, the attacker can use various tools and techniques. One common method involves using PowerShell scripts or Azure CLI to list resources like virtual machines, storage accounts, or databases in an Azure environment. Defenders, on the other hand, can implement measures like enforcing strict access controls, monitoring activity logs, and regular security audits to prevent unauthorized enumeration and access.


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of Az Unauthenticated Enum & Initial Entry has been around since the advent of cloud computing, particularly with the rise of Microsoft Azure. However, it has become increasingly prevalent in recent years due to the growing adoption of Azure for various business applications.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Az Unauthenticated Enum & Initial Entry starts with a simple enumeration of resources. This can be done using PowerShell scripts or Azure CLI commands that list the resources without needing any authentication. Once the resources are enumerated, the attacker can attempt to gain access to these resources by exploiting vulnerabilities or weak security configurations. The defender's task is to detect and stop such enumeration and unauthorized access attempts by implementing robust security measures. These include setting up strict access controls, monitoring activity logs for any suspicious activity, performing regular security audits, and keeping the Azure environment up-to-date with the latest patches and security updates.
