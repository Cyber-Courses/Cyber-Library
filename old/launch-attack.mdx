# Launch Attack


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

A Launch Attack is a cyber-attack where an attacker deploys a malicious software or program to gain unauthorized access or control over a network or system.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Understanding Launch Attacks is crucial as they pose a significant threat to the security of digital systems and data. They can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or even system failures. Protecting against these attacks helps to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital systems and data.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To protect against Launch Attacks, one needs to have a robust security posture. This includes regular system updates, use of strong and unique passwords, enabling firewalls, running anti-virus and anti-malware scans, and educating users about safe online practices.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Cyber attacks, including launch attacks, have been on the rise since the onset of the digital era. Their frequency has particularly increased with the widespread use of the internet and digital systems in the last two decades.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

A typical Launch Attack begins with the attacker probing for potential vulnerabilities within the target system. This may involve scanning the system to identify weaknesses that can be exploited. Once a vulnerability is pinpointed, the attacker either develops or utilizes an existing malicious software or program that is designed to exploit this vulnerability.

This development phase may require advanced technical skills and an in-depth understanding of computer systems. The malicious software or program can be designed to perform a range of actions, such as data theft, service disruption, or establishing a backdoor for further control.

The next step is deploying the malicious software or program onto the target system. This can be done in several ways, for instance, by tricking a user into clicking a link or opening an attachment carrying the malware, or by exploiting a system vulnerability to install the software without the user's knowledge.

Once the malicious software or program is within the system, it can start performing malicious activities. These can vary based on the attacker's objectives and the nature of the malware. For example, it might steal sensitive data, such as login credentials or financial information, disrupt services by rendering systems inoperable, or establish control over the system that allows the attacker to perform additional actions in the future.

For example, consider a real-world scenario where an attacker launches a SQL Injection attack, which is a type of Launch Attack.

1. **Identify vulnerability:** The attacker discovers that a web application does not properly sanitize user input in its login form.
2. **Develop malicious software:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL statement like `' OR '1'='1`, intending to manipulate the SQL query used for user authentication.
3. **Deploy malicious software:** The attacker enters the malicious SQL statement into the username or password field of the login form and submits the form.
4. **Perform malicious activity:** If the web application appends the user input directly into a SQL query, the malicious SQL statement can manipulate the query to always return true, bypassing the authentication mechanism. This would give the attacker unauthorized access to the system.

Here's a simple code example illustrating the flawed authentication mechanism:

```python
def authenticate(username, password):
    # Flawed authentication mechanism
    sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'"
    result = database.execute(sql)
    if result:
        return 'Login successful'
    else:
        return 'Login failed'

```

In this example, if an attacker inputs `' OR '1'='1` as the username, the SQL query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'whatever'`, which always returns true, granting the attacker access.
