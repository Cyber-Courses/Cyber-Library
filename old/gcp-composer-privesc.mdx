# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

GCP - Composer Privesc works by leveraging the Cloud Composer's feature of executing Apache Airflow pipelines. The pipelines are executed with high-level permissions, which can be potentially exploited for privilege escalation. The tool scans the environment and checks for any misconfigurations or weak security settings that could allow such exploitation. It then provides a detailed report of its findings, along with recommendations for mitigating the identified risks.
