# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Azure operates on a cloud computing model. This model uses a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. Azure services can be categorized into different types like IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service). Among these, IaaS is the most flexible cloud computing model. PaaS allows users to create web applications quickly without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, and with SaaS, Microsoft provides the complete infrastructure to the users.
