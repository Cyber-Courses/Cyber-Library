# 2375, 2376 Pentesting Docker


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Pentesting Docker is the practice of assessing the security of Docker containers and their underlying infrastructure. Docker containers are a type of software packaging platform that isolates an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit that can run on any system with Docker installed. This process involves understanding the structure and configuration of Docker containers, identifying vulnerabilities, and exploiting them to assess the potential impact.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Pentesting Docker is important because containers are increasingly being used to deploy applications in development and production environments. While Docker containers offer several advantages such as portability, efficiency, and scalability, they also introduce new security challenges. They can be susceptible to a variety of attacks, including container breakout, insecure images, misconfigurations, and more. A successful attack can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of services, or even takeover of the host system. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of containerized applications.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Pentesting Docker involves several steps. First, gather information about the Docker environment, such as running containers, images, and configurations. Tools like Docker Bench for Security can automate this process. Next, identify potential vulnerabilities using manual inspection or automated scanning tools. Exploit these vulnerabilities to understand their potential impact. For example, you might try to escape the container and gain access to the host system. Finally, document your findings, including the identified vulnerabilities, exploited vulnerabilities, and potential remedies. This information is essential for developers and operations teams to secure their Docker environments.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Pentesting Docker should be a continuous process, integrated into the software development life cycle. It should start in the early stages of development, continue through deployment, and regularly throughout the life of the application. This ensures that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed as early as possible, reducing the potential for exploitation.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Docker containers are essentially self-contained, isolated environments that run on a host system's kernel. They have their own filesystem, networking stack, and process space, which makes them highly portable and efficient for deploying applications.

However, this isolation is not foolproof. The Docker daemon, which manages the containers, runs with root privileges on the host system. If an attacker is able to exploit a vulnerability in the Docker daemon, they could potentially gain root access to the host, compromising the entire system.

Moreover, Docker containers can be run with escalated privileges, which can increase the attack surface. For instance, a container running as root has the same privileges as the root user on the host system. If an attacker compromises this container, they could potentially gain control over the host.

Another potential vulnerability stems from the use of insecure images. Docker images are the basis for containers and if these images contain vulnerabilities, any container created from them would inherit these vulnerabilities.

Therefore, while Docker offers many benefits in terms of application deployment, it also introduces new security challenges. It's crucial to understand the technical aspects of Docker security and regularly conduct penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

Pentesting Docker involves gathering information about the Docker environment, identifying potential vulnerabilities, exploiting these vulnerabilities to evaluate their potential impact, and documenting the findings. This process should be integrated into the software development life cycle to ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed as early as possible.

In summary, Docker security requires a thorough understanding of Docker's technical intricacies, careful configuration and management of Docker environments, and an ongoing commitment to vulnerability detection and mitigation.

Here's an illustrative example of how to perform a basic Docker pentest:

1. **Gathering Information**:
First, you need to gather information about the Docker environment. You can use the `docker ps` command to list all running containers:
    
    ```
    docker ps
    
    ```
    
    This will return information like the container ID, image, command, created time, status, ports, and names.
    
2. **Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities**:
Now, let's say you want to check if any Docker containers are running with escalated privileges. You can use the `docker inspect` command to check the security configuration of a container:
    
    ```
    docker inspect --format '{{ .Config.User }}' <Container ID>
    
    ```
    
    If this command returns 'root', it means the container is running with root privileges, which is a potential security risk.
    
3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**:
If a container is running as root, an attacker might be able to gain access to the host system. To demonstrate this, you could create a simple file on the host system from within the container:
    
    ```
    docker exec -it <Container ID> /bin/sh -c "echo 'This is a test' > /tmp/test.txt"
    
    ```
    
    Then, on the host system, check if the file was created:
    
    ```
    cat /tmp/test.txt
    
    ```
    
    If you see the text 'This is a test', it means the container was able to write to the host system, demonstrating a potential security issue.
    
4. **Documenting Findings**:
Once you've identified and exploited vulnerabilities, you should document your findings. This might include the vulnerabilities identified, the methods used to exploit them, the potential impact, and recommendations for remediation.

Remember that this is a simplified example. A real Docker pentest would involve much more complexity and depth, and would require a thorough understanding of Docker security and pentesting techniques.
