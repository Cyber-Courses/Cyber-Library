Technically, Account Takeover attacks typically involve a combination of methods such as phishing, malware, and brute force attacks. In a phishing attack, the attacker tricks the victim into revealing their login credentials. Malware, on the other hand, can be used to capture keystrokes or take screenshots to steal the user's login information. Brute force attacks involve guessing the user's password by trying different combinations until the correct one is found.
