# Az - ACR


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> AZ-ACR (Azure Access Control Resource) is a feature within Microsoft's Azure cloud platform that offers a range of security and governance controls. It enables administrators to define, enforce and manage access policies across various Azure resources, thus helping to maintain data security and compliance.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> With the increasing shift towards cloud-based systems, managing access to resources effectively is crucial. Uncontrolled access can lead to data breaches, non-compliance issues, and unauthorized use of resources. AZ-ACR provides an efficient way to manage who can access what resources, ensuring data security and regulatory compliance.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To leverage AZ-ACR, start by navigating to the Azure portal. Here, you can create and manage access policies for different resources. You can define roles with specific permissions and assign these roles to users, groups, or service principals. Additionally, Azure also provides pre-defined roles that can be used directly.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The use of AZ-ACR became more prominent with the rise of cloud computing and the need for effective resource management within cloud environments. Organizations started implementing AZ-ACR as they moved their operations to the Azure platform.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

At its core, AZ-ACR operates on the principles of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). RBAC is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users. In the context of AZ-ACR, these roles are assigned permissions to various Azure resources. These permissions define what actions a role can and cannot perform. This way, administrators can control who has access to what resources, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. AZ-ACR also supports Azure Policies, which allow administrators to create, assign and manage policies that enforce different rules and effects over resources, further enhancing security and compliance.
