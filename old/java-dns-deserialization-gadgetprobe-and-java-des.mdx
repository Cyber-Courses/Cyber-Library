# Java DNS Deserialization, GadgetProbe and Java Deserialization Scanner


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Java DNS Deserialization is a vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely by exploiting the deserialization process of Java objects. GadgetProbe is a tool that detects Java deserialization vulnerabilities by sending serialized objects ('gadgets') to the target application and monitoring the DNS resolution requests. Java Deserialization Scanner is another tool used to identify and exploit Java deserialization vulnerabilities.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding these concepts is crucial because Java deserialization vulnerabilities are common and can lead to serious security breaches, such as remote code execution, unauthorized access, and data corruption. By leveraging tools like GadgetProbe and Java Deserialization Scanner, security professionals can identify and fix these vulnerabilities, thereby strengthening the security posture of their Java applications.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use GadgetProbe, start by generating a list of gadget chains using the 'generate' command. Then, send the serialized gadgets to the target application using the 'probe' command. If the application is vulnerable, it will trigger DNS resolution requests, which GadgetProbe will capture and report. Similarly, to use Java Deserialization Scanner, input the target URL and select the appropriate attack vectors. The tool will then scan the application and report any potential vulnerabilities.


### ⏳ When ?

These tools and techniques have been used since the discovery of the Java deserialization vulnerability in 2015. They have become an integral part of the toolkit of penetration testers and security researchers who work with Java applications.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Java DNS Deserialization exploits the way Java handles the serialization and deserialization of objects. Serialization is the process of converting an object's state to a byte stream, and deserialization is the reverse process. If an attacker can manipulate the byte stream before it's deserialized, they can create a malicious object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code. GadgetProbe and Java Deserialization Scanner work by exploiting this process. They send serialized objects with known gadget chains to the target application and monitor its behavior. If the application deserializes the malicious object, it indicates a deserialization vulnerability, which the tools report.
