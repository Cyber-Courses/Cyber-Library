# Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass refers to the method of exploiting weaknesses in the security policies of a website, allowing for potential malicious activities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.


### 🧐 Why ?

CSP Bypass is significant because it exposes the vulnerability of a website to attacks that may lead to disclosure of sensitive user data. Without understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, websites may be left open to potential security breaches.


### ⛏️ How ?

To carry out a CSP bypass, an attacker may exploit various techniques such as insecure inline script usage, allowing for scripts to be executed from any source, or exploiting policy whitelists that may include unsafe URLs.


### ⏳ When ?

CSP bypass techniques have been used by attackers ever since the inception of Content Security Policies as a method to protect against cross-site scripting and other code injection attacks.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

CSP Bypass exploits the vulnerabilities in a website's CSP, which is intended to prevent unauthorized execution of scripts. This is done by injecting malicious scripts into a webpage and manipulating the CSP to permit the execution of these scripts. Various methods can be used to circumvent the CSP, including the misuse of inline scripts, exploiting policy whitelists, or leveraging about: protocol links. These vulnerabilities can be mitigated by implementing strict CSPs and regularly reviewing them for potential weaknesses.
