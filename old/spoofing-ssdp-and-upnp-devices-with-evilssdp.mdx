# Spoofing SSDP and UPnP Devices with EvilSSDP


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Spoofing Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) and Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) devices refers to the act of impersonating these devices or services on a network using a tool called EvilSSDP. This malicious technique is often used to trick users into interacting with the spoofed device or service, potentially leading to data leakage or other security compromises.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Understanding this technique is crucial as it is commonly used in penetration testing and cyber attacks. The ability to spoof SSDP and UPnP devices can enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to a network and its resources, steal sensitive data, or carry out other malicious activities. It is therefore important for IT professionals, particularly those in the cyber security field, to understand this threat in order to better protect their networks.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

EvilSSDP is a tool that can be used to spoof SSDP and UPnP devices. To use this tool, one first needs to set up a server that will act as the spoofed device or service. The server must be configured to respond to SSDP discovery messages with a location pointing to the attacker's machine. Once the server is set up, the attacker can then send out SSDP discovery messages to the target devices, tricking them into interacting with the spoofed server.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The use of SSDP and UPnP spoofing has been prevalent since the mid-2000s, with the advent of UPnP and the proliferation of devices utilizing this protocol. However, the development and use of tools like EvilSSDP have made this technique more accessible to attackers in recent years.

SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) and UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) are protocols designed to simplify device discovery and interaction on a network. They enable devices to advertise their services and respond to discovery requests from other devices, thus facilitating seamless connectivity.

In an ideal scenario, SSDP allows devices to recognize each other on a network with minimal configuration. Similarly, UPnP enables devices to connect and interact smoothly on a network, providing a user-friendly experience. These protocols are integral to many modern networks, supporting a wide array of devices and applications.

However, the convenience and ease of use provided by these protocols can be manipulated for malicious purposes. An attacker can exploit these protocols to impersonate, or 'spoof', a legitimate device or service on the network. The attacker's device responds to discovery requests as if it were the genuine device, tricking other devices into interacting with the spoofed entity. This deceptive interaction can lead to various security breaches, including unauthorized network access, data theft, and other forms of cyber-attacks.

Setting up this kind of spoofing attack can be intricate and require a deep understanding of network protocols and interactions. However, tools like EvilSSDP have streamlined this process. EvilSSDP automates the creation and management of the spoofed server, significantly easing the attacker's work. Moreover, it handles the dispatch of SSDP discovery messages, further enabling the attack process.

Given the potential threats posed by this spoofing technique, it is paramount for IT professionals to understand how it works. By fully grasping the mechanisms of SSDP and UPnP spoofing, they can better anticipate potential vulnerabilities and implement effective network protections.

A real-world example of SSDP and UPnP spoofing using EvilSSDP could look as follows:

1. **Set up the EvilSSDP server**: The first step is to download and set up EvilSSDP on your machine. This can be done using the following command on a Linux terminal:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/initstring/evilssdp.git
cd evilssdp

```

1. **Configure the server**: The next step is to configure the server. You can do this by creating a configuration file and specifying the IP address and port for the fake server, as well as the service you want to spoof. For example:

```bash
echo '{"ip": "192.168.1.100", "port": 80, "service": "Fake Printer"}' config.json

```

In this example, the spoofed device is a printer with IP address `192.168.1.100` and port `80`.

1. **Start the server**: Now, you can start the server using the following command:

```bash
./evilssdp.py -i en0 -c config.json

```

In this example, `en0` is the network interface to use for the spoofing attack, and `config.json` is the configuration file you created in the previous step.

1. **Initiate spoofing**: Once the server is up and running, it will automatically respond to SSDP discovery messages as if it were the legitimate device. Other devices on the network will think they're interacting with the genuine device, leading to potential security breaches.
2. **Monitoring activity**: You can monitor the activity on your server to see what devices are interacting with it and what data is being transferred. This can provide valuable insights into potential vulnerabilities in the network.

Remember, this example is for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.
