# GCP - BigQuery Persistence


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. BigQuery Persistence refers to the process of storing and managing this data in a way that it remains accessible and usable over a long period.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> BigQuery Persistence is a crucial aspect of data management in the GCP ecosystem. It ensures that large datasets are not only stored securely but are also readily available for analysis. This feature is important for businesses and organizations that rely on data-driven decision making. BigQuery's ability to handle petabytes of data with ease makes it an invaluable tool for businesses dealing with large amounts of data.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To leverage BigQuery Persistence, you must first have a GCP account. From the GCP Console, you can create a new BigQuery dataset. Once the dataset is created, you can import your data from various sources like Google Cloud Storage, local files, or even from another BigQuery table. The data imported is then stored persistently in BigQuery, allowing for seamless data analysis using SQL queries.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> BigQuery was introduced by Google in 2012 as a part of its Google Cloud Platform. Since then, it has become a preferred tool for large scale data analytics due to its speed, scalability, and ease of use.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

At a technical level, BigQuery leverages Google's Dremel technology, a scalable, interactive ad-hoc query system for the analysis of read-only nested data. Dremel's architecture separates query execution from storage management, allowing BigQuery to scale and deliver high-speed analysis. Data in BigQuery is stored in Capacitor, Google's next-generation columnar storage format, improving on the performance of traditional relational database systems. Capacitor's advanced compression techniques reduce the storage footprint and increase query speed, further enhancing the benefits of BigQuery Persistence.
