# Windows Abusing Active Directory ACLs/ACEs


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Windows Abusing Active Directory ACLs/ACEs refers to the misuse of Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Access Control Entries (ACEs) in a Windows Active Directory environment. ACLs and ACEs are fundamental security features that determine the permissions for objects in an Active Directory. Abuse typically involves manipulating these permissions to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding this topic is crucial because ACLs and ACEs are integral to securing Active Directory environments. Misconfigurations or weaknesses can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges. As such, knowledge of potential abuse scenarios can help mitigate risks and enhance cybersecurity.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To prevent abuse of Active Directory ACLs/ACEs, follow best practices for configuration. Regularly audit permissions to detect any anomalies, and apply the principle of least privilege, granting users and roles only the permissions they need to perform their tasks. Use tools like BloodHound to visualize Active Directory permissions and identify potential vulnerabilities.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The abuse of Active Directory ACLs/ACEs has been a concern since the inception of Active Directory. However, it has gained more attention in recent years due to the increasing sophistication of cyber threats.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Active Directory ACLs/ACEs determine the permissions for objects. An ACL is a list of ACEs, and each ACE specifies the permissions for a security principal (user, group, or computer) to perform a specific action on an object. Abuse can occur when an attacker gains permissions to modify an ACL, allowing them to change permissions for other objects, potentially leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. Tools like BloodHound can help visualize these relationships and identify potential vulnerabilities.
