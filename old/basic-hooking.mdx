### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Basic Hooking refers to a technique in software engineering and cybersecurity where a programmer manipulates the behavior of an operating system, applications, or other software by intercepting function calls or changing function pointers stored in memory.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding Basic Hooking is crucial as it forms the basis for various cybersecurity attacks and defenses. It is used by programmers to modify or extend the behavior of software or troubleshoot problems. However, it can also be used maliciously by attackers to inject malware, spy on user actions, or manipulate software behavior. Therefore, anyone interested in cybersecurity, particularly penetration testing and defensive measures, should understand Basic Hooking to identify potential vulnerabilities and develop effective countermeasures.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To implement Basic Hooking, one must first identify the function to be hooked. This can be done by monitoring the API calls made by a particular application. Once the function is identified, one can use tools like Detours or Microsoft's API hooking methods to intercept the function call and modify its behavior. However, caution must be exercised as improper hooking can lead to system instability or crashes.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Basic Hooking began to be widely used in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the rise of malware and advanced persistent threats. It has since become a fundamental technique in cybersecurity, both for attackers seeking to exploit systems and defenders looking to secure them.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Basic Hooking is a sophisticated technique in the fields of software engineering and cybersecurity. It allows a programmer to influence the behavior of an operating system, applications, or other software by intercepting function calls or altering function pointers stored in memory.

This process involves identifying a particular function that one wishes to 'hook' into. This could be achieved by monitoring the API calls made by a specific application. Once the target function is identified, tools like Detours or Microsoft's API hooking methods can be used to intercept the function call and manipulate its behavior.

The key to this process is replacing the initial instructions of the target function with a 'jump' command. This command redirects the execution to the hooking code. The hooking code then carries out additional actions before calling the original function, effectively controlling and modifying its behavior.

However, it's crucial to note that this technique requires a thorough understanding of low-level programming and assembly language. The process requires precision and care, as improper hooking can lead to system instability or crashes.

Although Basic Hooking is a powerful tool for programmers to modify or extend software behavior, it can also be employed maliciously by attackers. It can be used to inject malware, spy on user actions, or manipulate software behavior. Therefore, it's crucial for anyone involved in cybersecurity to understand Basic Hooking to identify potential vulnerabilities and devise effective countermeasures.

For example, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where a programmer wants to hook into the 'print' function in a Python application to log all print statements for debugging purposes.

1. First, the original 'print' function needs to be saved to call it later:
    
    ```python
    orig_print = print
    
    ```
    
2. Then, a new function is defined that will replace the original 'print'. This function logs the print statements and calls the original 'print' function:
    
    ```python
    def new_print(*args, **kwargs):
        with open('log.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(' '.join(map(str,args)) + '\\n')
        orig_print(*args, **kwargs)
    
    ```
    
3. Finally, the 'print' function is replaced with the new function:
Now, every time the 'print' function is called in the application, it will also log the print statement in a file called 'log.txt'.
    
    ```python
    print = new_print
    
    ```
    

This is a simplified example of hooking. In real-world scenarios, hooking usually involves manipulating function pointers in binary executables or the memory of running processes, which requires in-depth knowledge of low-level programming, operating systems, and computer architecture.

Note: Modifying built-in functions like 'print' in Python is generally not recommended as it can lead to unexpected behavior and is considered bad practice. This example is purely for illustrative purposes.
