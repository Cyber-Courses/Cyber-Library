# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) AI Platform Enum is a Google Cloud service which allows developers to create, build and train machine learning models. Enum in this context refers to enumeration, a process that names and identifies different elements within a dataset or system.


### 🧐 Why ?

The GCP AI Platform Enum is important as it provides a scalable and efficient way to handle and process large amounts of data. With the growth of big data and the increasing need for businesses to make data-driven decisions, having a robust platform for building and training machine learning models is crucial.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use GCP AI Platform Enum, you need to first set up a GCP account and create a new project. Once that's done, you can navigate to the AI Platform section of the console. Here, you can create new instances, train models, and make predictions. It's important to note that understanding machine learning and data processing is essential for using the AI Platform Enum effectively.


### ⏳ When ?

The GCP AI Platform Enum has been in use since Google Cloud has introduced its AI and machine learning services. It's been increasingly utilized as the demand for AI and machine learning solutions in various industries has grown.
