# GCP - Compute Privesc


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Privesc refers to the process of escalating privileges within the GCP Compute Engine. The Compute Engine is an infrastructure-as-a-service that allows users to run virtual machines on Google's infrastructure. Privilege escalation occurs when a user gains more privileges or access rights than they were initially granted, often exploiting a flaw in a system.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP Compute Privesc is vital as it's a potential security risk. If an unauthorized user gains escalated privileges, they may access sensitive information, disrupt services, or use the environment for malicious purposes. Therefore, knowing how it works can help in developing strategies to prevent such security breaches.


### ⛏️ How ?

To take advantage of GCP Compute Privesc, one needs to exploit a flaw or weakness in the system. This could be a misconfiguration, a bug in the software, or weak security controls. Once the weak point is identified, the attacker can then use various techniques to gain higher privileges than they were initially assigned. However, to prevent this from happening, regular system audits, robust security controls, and timely patching of software vulnerabilities should be implemented.


### ⏳ When ?

GCP Compute Privesc has been a potential issue since the introduction of the GCP Compute Engine. As long as systems and software have vulnerabilities, there will always be the potential for privilege escalation.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Compute Privesc involves exploiting a vulnerability in the GCP Compute Engine to gain escalated privileges. This could be due to a system misconfiguration, bugs in the software, or weak security controls. Once an attacker identifies a weak point, they can use techniques such as spoofing, brute force attacks, or code injection to escalate their privileges. To prevent this, system administrators should regularly audit systems, implement strong security controls, and patch software vulnerabilities promptly.
