### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft technology used to manage computers and other devices on a network. It is a directory service that provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. For example, an AD domain controller authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network‚Äîassigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software.

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Active Directory is important because it improves security, supports web application services, and centralizes the tasks of network administration. It is designed to manage domains, which are groups of resources that work together and can be managed as a single entity. Without AD, managing and securing a large number of network resources would be a complex and time-consuming task. It is crucial for readers to understand AD because it is a fundamental component of Microsoft's Windows Server operating systems and is used extensively in corporate environments.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use Active Directory, first, you need to install it on your server. This is done through the 'Server Manager' in Windows Server. Once installed, you can open the 'Active Directory Users and Computers' (ADUC) tool to manage users, computers, groups, and other aspects of the network. The ADUC tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) through which administrators can perform tasks such as creating users, assigning group policies, and setting up organizational units (OUs).

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Active Directory was first released in 1999 as part of Windows 2000 Server edition, and it has been updated and included in all subsequent Windows Server editions.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft technology that manages computers and other devices on a network. It is a directory service that provides methods for storing data and making it available to network users and administrators. AD is integral to Microsoft's Windows Server operating systems and is widely used in corporate settings.

AD is organized hierarchically, using a structured data store known as the directory. This directory contains data about AD objects, which can include shared resources such as servers, volumes, printers, and network user and computer accounts. These objects form the backbone of the network, and their data is used to manage and control access to network resources.

Security is a key aspect of AD. It is integrated through logon authentication and access control to objects in the directory. This means that when a user logs into the network, their credentials are checked against the AD data store. If their credentials are valid, they are granted access based on the permissions associated with their account. This security feature allows administrators to control who has access to what resources on the network.

Another significant feature of AD is its ability to manage directory data and organization across the network with a single network logon. This means that an administrator can make changes that apply to the entire network from one central location, simplifying network management.

Furthermore, AD allows authorized users to access resources anywhere on the network. This is facilitated through the use of network protocols and services, which enable communication between different devices and parts of the network.

To utilize AD, it must first be installed on your server via the 'Server Manager' in Windows Server. After installation, the 'Active Directory Users and Computers' (ADUC) tool can be used to manage various aspects of the network. This tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI), making it more user-friendly and straightforward to create users, assign group policies, and set up organizational units (OUs).

In conclusion, Active Directory is a powerful tool for managing and securing networks. Its structured, hierarchical organization makes it easy to manage large amounts of data, and its integrated security features ensure that only authorized users can access network resources. It simplifies network management by enabling administrators to control the network from a central location, and it allows users to access network resources from anywhere.
