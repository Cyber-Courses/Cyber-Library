# Ret2syscall


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Ret2syscall is a technique used in cybersecurity to exploit certain vulnerabilities in a system. It involves redirecting the execution flow of a program to a syscall stub in the binary.


### 🧐 Why ?

The Ret2syscall technique is important in the cybersecurity field because it allows for the exploitation of certain vulnerabilities in systems that are otherwise considered secure. This technique can be used to gain unauthorized access to a system, bypass security measures, or execute malicious code. Our readers should be interested in this topic because understanding how such techniques work can help in developing more secure systems and in identifying potential security threats.


### ⛏️ How ?

Implementing the Ret2syscall technique involves several steps. First, you need to identify a vulnerability in the system that can be exploited. This could be a buffer overflow vulnerability or another type of vulnerability that allows for the control of the execution flow of a program. Once the vulnerability has been identified, you can then redirect the execution flow to a syscall stub in the binary. This can be done by overwriting the return address on the stack with the address of the syscall stub. Finally, you need to ensure that the correct parameters are passed to the syscall stub in order for it to execute the desired system call.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of the Ret2syscall technique has been prevalent in the cybersecurity field for several years. It is often used in penetration testing and other security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in a system.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Ret2syscall is a technique used in exploit development that involves redirecting the control flow of a program to a syscall stub in the binary. This technique is often used when the binary does not contain the necessary gadgets for a traditional ret2libc attack. A syscall stub is a small piece of code that sets up the necessary registers for a system call and then invokes it. By redirecting the control flow to a syscall stub, an attacker can invoke any system call they want, as long as the correct parameters are passed. This can be used to bypass certain security measures, such as non-executable stacks or address space layout randomization (ASLR).
