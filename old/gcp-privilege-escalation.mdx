# GCP - Privilege Escalation


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Privilege Escalation refers to the act of exploiting some vulnerabilities in GCP to escalate one's privileges, gaining more access rights than initially granted. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, resources, or even take control of the cloud environment.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Understanding GCP Privilege Escalation is crucial because it poses significant security risks, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or disruption of services. It's especially important for organizations leveraging GCP for their operations to be aware of this. It is also a vital concept for cybersecurity professionals to grasp, as it is a common attack vector in cloud environments.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To prevent GCP Privilege Escalation, it's crucial to follow best practices such as implementing the principle of least privilege, regularly auditing permissions, and using tools to detect suspicious activities. Google also provides services like Cloud IAM, which allows you to manage access control by defining who (identity) has what access (role) for which resource.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The issue of privilege escalation in cloud services, including GCP, has been a concern ever since these services started gaining popularity in the mid-2000s. With the increasing adoption of cloud services, the potential for privilege escalation has become more prevalent.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

GCP Privilege Escalation typically involves an attacker exploiting misconfigurations, flaws, or bugs in the system to gain higher-level privileges. For instance, an attacker might exploit a misconfigured service account that has been given excessive permissions to escalate their privileges. Google Cloud Platform uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage and control access to resources. IAM works based on roles, which are collections of permissions. The potential for privilege escalation exists if a role contains more permissions than necessary for a particular task, or if permissions are not correctly revoked when no longer needed.
