# APK decompilers


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

APK Decompilers are tools that reverse engineer compiled Android apps or APK files into their source codes. They decode the '.apk' files into possible source code. With the help of these decompilers, one can get the source code of any Android application and can edit it to remove license and credits.


### 🧐 Why ?

APK Decompilers play a vital role in cybersecurity. They aid in understanding the underlying code for any given Android application. This can help in identifying malicious code, vulnerabilities or suspicious activities within the app. Such insights are essential for security researchers, developers, and penetration testers. Additionally, they can be used for educational purposes, to understand how certain functionalities are coded and implemented in Android.


### ⛏️ How ?

Using an APK decompiler is typically straightforward. Most decompilers have a user-friendly interface where you can upload the APK file you want to decompile. Once uploaded, the decompiler will process the file and provide the source code. However, it's worth noting that the code you get may not be exactly what the original developers wrote, as some elements (like comments or variable names) may be lost in the process of compilation.


### ⏳ When ?

APK Decompilers have been in use since the early days of Android development. As Android grew in popularity, so did the need for tools that could reverse engineer its apps. Today, they are widely used tools in the world of Android development and cybersecurity.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, APK decompilers work by translating the machine code in an APK file back into a human-readable format. When an Android application is compiled, the source code is converted into machine code that can be executed by the Android runtime environment. This process involves several steps, including the conversion of '.java' files into '.class' files using a Java compiler, and then into '.dex' (Dalvik Executable) files. The APK decompiler reverses this process, converting '.dex' files back into '.class' files, and then into '.java' files. However, the resulting code is not always perfect, as some information is inevitably lost during the initial compilation process.
