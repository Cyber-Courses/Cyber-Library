# GCP - Containers & GKE Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP, short for Google Cloud Platform, is a suite of cloud computing services. One key feature of GCP is its containerization services, which allow developers to package and run applications in isolated environments known as containers. GKE Enum, or Google Kubernetes Engine Enumeration, is a method used to identify and gather information about containers running in a GKE environment.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP, Containers and GKE Enum is crucial due to their widespread use in modern cloud-based application development and deployment. Their importance goes beyond just the realm of developers - cybersecurity professionals also need to understand these concepts to identify potential vulnerabilities and defend against attacks. GKE Enum, for instance, could be exploited by malicious actors to gather sensitive information about a GKE environment, leading to potential data breaches or other security incidents.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use GCP and its container services, you would first need to create a GCP account and set up a project. From there, you can create and manage your containers using the Google Cloud Console or the gcloud command-line tool. As for GKE Enum, it would typically be performed using specialized enumeration tools or scripts that send various requests to the GKE API and analyze the responses for valuable information.


### ⏳ When ?

Google Cloud Platform was launched in 2008, and its container services have been available since around 2014. The practice of GKE enumeration, like other types of enumeration, has likely been around for as long as GKE itself, as it is a fundamental part of any penetration testing or vulnerability assessment process.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At the heart of GCP's container services is Google Kubernetes Engine, a managed service that allows you to run Docker containers on Google Cloud. Containers are isolated environments where applications run along with all their dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different systems. In a GKE environment, containers are organized into pods, which are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes. GKE Enum involves querying the Kubernetes API to gather information about these pods and other objects in the GKE environment. This could include the pod's metadata, running status, associated service accounts, and more. While this is a normal part of managing a GKE environment, it could also be used maliciously to gather sensitive information, underscoring the importance of proper access control and security measures.
