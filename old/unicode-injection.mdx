# Unicode Injection


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Unicode Injection is a form of cybersecurity attack where malicious unicode characters are injected into a vulnerable system to affect its operations or extract sensitive data.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding Unicode Injection is crucial for both developers and security professionals. Developers need to understand it to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in their code, while security professionals need to be aware of it to detect and mitigate such attacks. Unicode Injection can lead to serious security breaches, including data loss, unauthorized access, or system crashes.


### ⛏️ How ?

To exploit a system vulnerable to Unicode Injection, an attacker would inject malicious unicode characters into the application’s input. These characters can be designed to bypass validation mechanisms, manipulate data, or execute unauthorized commands. To prevent Unicode Injection, developers should use secure input validation techniques, sanitize all user inputs, and employ a strong system of encoding and decoding unicode characters.


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of Unicode Injection has been around since the advent of unicode character encoding. However, it has gained more attention in recent years due to the increased complexity of web applications and the associated rise in security vulnerabilities.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At the core of Unicode Injection lies the universal character set Unicode, which enables representation of almost every character in every written language. However, due to its complexity, handling Unicode securely can be challenging. For instance, Unicode includes a wide range of control characters and special characters, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly handled. Moreover, Unicode has several ways to represent the same character (such as using combining characters), which can be exploited to bypass validation mechanisms. An attacker can use these characteristics to inject malicious unicode characters into a vulnerable application, leading to various security issues.
