# Python Yaml Deserialization


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Python YAML deserialization refers to the process of converting a YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) document, a human-readable data serialization format, back into Python objects. This is a fundamental concept in Python programming and scripting, especially when working with configuration files, network data transmission and storage of data objects.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding Python YAML deserialization is crucial as it helps in handling YAML files which are often used for configuration files, log files, Internet messaging and data serialization. Moreover, YAML files are easily readable and writeable by humans, and correspondingly easy for machines to parse and generate. Therefore, it's importance cannot be overstated for developers and programmers who often need to handle such files.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> In Python, the most common library for YAML deserialization is PyYAML. You can install it using pip install pyyaml. Once installed, you can import it in your Python script and use yaml.load() function to deserialize the YAML document into a Python object. However, it's important to note that using yaml.load() function can be unsafe as it can execute arbitrary Python commands. Therefore, it's recommended to use yaml.safe_load() function which does not have this vulnerability.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Python YAML deserialization is typically used when there is a need to parse YAML files into Python objects. This might be when reading configuration files, parsing log files or when transmitting data over network protocols that use YAML.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

YAML, or Yet Another Markup Language, is a human-readable data serialization format. In the context of Python, 'deserialization' refers to the process of converting a serialized format of data, in this case YAML, back into Python objects. This is typically accomplished using the PyYAML library. The PyYAML library provides a high-level API for parsing YAML files and converting them into Python data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and scalars (i.e., single values). However, it's important to handle this process carefully because YAML deserialization can potentially execute arbitrary code, posing a security risk. As a solution, PyYAML provides a 'safe' method for parsing YAML files, known as yaml.safe_load(), which does not have this vulnerability.
