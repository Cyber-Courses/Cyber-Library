# GCP - Security Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Security enumeration in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) refers to the process of identifying and documenting the security controls in place within the GCP environment. It involves systematically identifying, classifying and documenting the security controls and mechanisms that are currently in place.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding the security controls within GCP is essential for maintaining a secure cloud environment. It provides crucial insights into the existing security posture, helping to identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Additionally, it's a critical step in compliance audits and helps organizations adhere to security standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.


### ⛏️ How ?

To perform security enumeration in GCP, you can use built-in tools like Cloud Security Scanner. This tool automatically scans App Engine, Compute Engine, and Google Kubernetes Engine applications for common vulnerabilities. You can also use third-party tools like Forseti, a community-driven collection of open-source tools developed by Google to ensure the security of Google Cloud Platform.


### ⏳ When ?

Security enumeration should be carried out regularly, especially when changes are made to the GCP environment such as adding new resources or services. Additionally, it should be performed as part of the routine security audits.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, security enumeration in GCP involves using tools to scan for resources and services within the GCP environment and documenting their security configurations. For example, it might include checking if Cloud Storage buckets are publicly accessible, if Cloud Functions are using service accounts with excessive permissions, or if VPC networks have firewall rules that allow unrestricted access. The end goal is to have a detailed understanding of the security posture and to ensure that the principle of least privilege is followed.
