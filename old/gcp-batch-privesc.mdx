# GCP - Batch Privesc


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP - Batch Privesc, also known as Google Cloud Platform Batch Privilege Escalation, is a cybersecurity technique used by attackers to gain escalated privileges in a batch processing environment within Google's cloud platform.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP - Batch Privesc is crucial as cloud environments are increasingly targeted by cyber attackers. GCP, being one of the popular cloud service providers, is no exception. This technique allows a low privilege user to gain higher privileges, potentially leading to serious security breaches.


### ⛏️ How ?

Batch Privesc in GCP typically involves exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the batch processing environment. A potential attacker starts by identifying weak points, such as poorly configured access controls or software vulnerabilities, and then leverages these to escalate their privileges.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of privilege escalation techniques in cloud environments, including GCP, has been on the rise as more businesses migrate to the cloud. However, it's difficult to pinpoint when exactly GCP - Batch Privesc started being practiced, as its usage tends to be covert.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, GCP - Batch Privesc involves exploiting the batch processing systems used in Google Cloud Platform. These systems are often used for processing large amounts of data. If an attacker can gain access to these systems, they can potentially escalate their privileges and gain access to sensitive data or resources. This often involves exploiting misconfigurations in the access controls for these systems or vulnerabilities in the software used for batch processing. For example, an attacker might find a way to insert malicious code into a batch processing job, thereby gaining the same level of access as that job. From there, they can potentially escalate their privileges further, depending on the specific configurations and vulnerabilities present.
