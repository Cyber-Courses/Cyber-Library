# GCP - Artifact Registry Post Exploitation


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Artifact Registry is a service that offers a single place for your team to manage container images and language packages (artifacts). It has native integration with Google Cloud services and allows users to manage, secure and store their artifacts with ease. Post exploitation refers to steps taken by attackers after gaining initial access to a system, with the goal of maintaining access, spreading within the system, and extracting valuable data.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding the concept of GCP Artifact Registry Post Exploitation is crucial due to the growing number of cloud-based services and the corresponding increase in security risks. If not properly secured, GCP Artifact Registry can be a potential entry point for attackers to gain unauthorized access and exploit the system. Post exploitation activities pose serious threats like data breaches, system damage, or even business disruption.


### ⛏️ How ?

To prevent post exploitation in GCP Artifact Registry, implement best practices such as: limiting access to only necessary users, regularly updating and patching software, monitoring the system for any unusual activities, and encrypting sensitive data. Google Cloud also offers built-in security features like Binary Authorization for container images and VPC Service Controls to secure your Artifact Registry.


### ⏳ When ?

GCP Artifact Registry was launched in 2020, and since then, its security implications, including post exploitation, have been a topic of interest for cybersecurity professionals. The need for understanding and mitigating post exploitation tactics has been essential ever since the advent of sophisticated cyber attacks.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Artifact Registry Post Exploitation involves attackers utilizing the system's vulnerabilities to perform malicious activities. Attackers may gain unauthorized access by exploiting weak security configurations, software bugs, or user privileges. Once inside, they can perform actions like privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, or even maintain their presence for future attacks. Prevention of such activities requires a deep understanding of the system's architecture, the potential vulnerabilities, and the implementation of robust security measures.
