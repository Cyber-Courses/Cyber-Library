# 8086 - Pentesting InfluxDB


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Pentesting InfluxDB is the process of testing the InfluxDB, an open-source time series database, for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a malicious hacker. The main purpose of this process is to identify potential security loopholes within the InfluxDB system.


### 🧐 Why ?

InfluxDB is widely used for high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics. Hence, it's crucial to ensure its security to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and system crashes. Vulnerabilities in InfluxDB could lead to severe consequences including leakage of sensitive information, interruption of services, or even complete system takeover by attackers.


### ⛏️ How ?

Pentesting InfluxDB involves several steps. First, enumerate the InfluxDB system to gather as much information as possible. Next, analyze the gathered data to identify potential weak points. Use penetration testing tools such as nmap and Metasploit to uncover vulnerabilities. Finally, attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities to understand the potential damage they could cause. Remember to always perform pentesting ethically and with proper authorization.


### ⏳ When ?

Pentesting should be conducted regularly as part of your organization's security measures. It is particularly important to perform pentesting when setting up a new InfluxDB system, after major changes or updates, or in response to a known threat or incident.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

InfluxDB, as a time series database, organizes data in a time-indexed format, which allows for efficient real-time analytics. However, this unique data structure presents certain vulnerabilities that may not exist in traditional databases. One such vulnerability could arise from inadequate access controls. If not properly managed, an attacker could exploit these controls to inject malicious data into the database. This could result in inaccurate analytics outcomes or, in severe cases, cause system crashes.

Furthermore, due to the real-time nature of InfluxDB, it is often used to monitor crucial systems and processes. Therefore, any disruption or manipulation of the data could have immediate and far-reaching impacts. To prevent this, it is essential to have robust access controls in place. This includes limiting who can add and modify data, implementing strong user authentication mechanisms, and regularly reviewing access logs for any suspicious activity.

Additionally, regular patching and updates are important for maintaining the security of an InfluxDB system. New vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered, and patches often address these security issues. By staying updated, you can ensure that your system is protected against known vulnerabilities.

Lastly, secure communication protocols should be used when transmitting data to and from your InfluxDB system. This can prevent attackers from intercepting and altering your data during transmission.

In summary, while InfluxDB's time-index format provides valuable benefits for real-time analytics, it also introduces unique security considerations. It is crucial to manage these appropriately to ensure the integrity and security of your data. This involves implementing strong access controls, keeping the system updated, and using secure communication protocols.

Here's a detailed, educational example of how an InfluxDB system could be tested for vulnerabilities:

1. **Information Gathering**: Begin by enumerating the InfluxDB system. This could involve using a tool like nmap to scan the system and identify open ports:

```
nmap -p- <influxdb-ip

```

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Once you've gathered information, you can start scanning for vulnerabilities. For instance, you might use a tool like nikto to perform a web server scan:

```
nikto -h <influxdb-ip

```

1. **Access Controls Testing**: Test the access controls of the InfluxDB system. Try to add data to the database without the proper permissions. If this is successful, it indicates a vulnerability:

```
curl -POST 'http://<influxdb-ip:8086/write?db=mydb' --data-binary 'temperature,location=london value=22'

```

1. **Authentication Mechanism Testing**: Test the strength of user authentication mechanisms by attempting to authenticate with weak or common credentials.
2. **Patch Verification**: Check whether the system is up-to-date with patches. If it's not, it could be vulnerable to known issues.
3. **Secure Communication Testing**: Ensure that data transmitted to and from your InfluxDB system is encrypted to prevent interception and alteration.

Remember, this process should only be performed with proper authorization. It's intended to identify and correct vulnerabilities, not to exploit them maliciously.
