# GCP - Add Custom SSH Metadata


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Adding custom SSH Metadata in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) refers to the process of incorporating personalized data within your SSH keys for GCP instances. These metadata can include user-provided information such as the SSH key's name, the user's name, or the SSH key's expiration date.


### 🧐 Why ?

Adding custom SSH metadata is an important practice in cybersecurity as it provides an additional layer of security. It allows system administrators to manage access to instances based on the metadata associated with the SSH keys. This can help in preventing unauthorized access and maintaining the integrity of the system. Moreover, it is a requirement in certain regulatory compliance standards.


### ⛏️ How ?

To add custom SSH Metadata in GCP, you first need to generate an SSH key pair. Once you have your SSH key pair, you can add the key to your project or instance metadata by navigating to the Metadata page in the GCP console. In the SSH Keys section, click on 'Edit' and then 'Add item', and paste your public SSH key into the box. Save your changes to update the metadata. Remember that any changes made to the project metadata will apply to all instances within the project.


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of adding custom SSH metadata in GCP, and in cloud instances more generally, has become commonplace as organizations move their infrastructure to the cloud. This practice began gaining traction with the rise of cloud computing, particularly with the inception of GCP in 2008.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Under the hood, GCP uses project-wide public SSH keys as a way to grant users access to instances. When a user tries to connect to an instance, GCP checks the project's metadata for a matching SSH key. If a match is found, the user is granted access. By adding custom metadata to SSH keys, administrators can enforce security measures such as key expiration, user-specific access controls, and others. It is important to note that while this process enhances security, it should be used in conjunction with other security measures like firewalls and secure network configurations.
