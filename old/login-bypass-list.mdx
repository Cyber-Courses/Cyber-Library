# Login bypass List


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Login bypass list is a collection of known methods and techniques to bypass the authentication process of a system, application or a network. It's a tool used mainly in penetration testing and cybersecurity audits to identify vulnerabilities in a system's security.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding login bypass techniques is important to both attack and defend a system. Attackers can use these techniques to gain unauthorized access to systems, while defenders can use this knowledge to identify and patch vulnerabilities.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use a login bypass list, you would typically start by identifying the type of system or application you are testing. Then, you would try each of the bypass techniques listed, noting any that are successful. Once you've identified a vulnerability, you should report it to the system owner or patch it yourself if you have the necessary access and skills.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The use of login bypass lists in penetration testing and cyber security audits became prevalent with the rise of the internet and the need for robust cyber security practices.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Bypassing a login involves exploiting flaws in a system's authentication process. This can be done in several ways, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and brute force attacks. SQL injection involves inserting malicious SQL code into a query, tricking the system into returning unauthorized data. Cross-site scripting (XSS) involves injecting malicious scripts into trusted websites, allowing an attacker to bypass access controls. Brute force attacks involve trying all possible combinations of passwords until the correct one is found. Understanding these techniques and how to prevent them is crucial in maintaining a secure system.
