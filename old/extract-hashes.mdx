# Extract hashes


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Extract hashes refers to the process of retrieving and identifying hash values from a system. Hash values are unique identifiers generated by a hash function, which is an algorithm that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a 'digest' that is unique to each unique input. Hashes are fundamental to various cybersecurity processes, including password storage and verification, digital signatures, and data integrity checks.

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Extracting hashes is important because it allows cybersecurity professionals to verify the integrity of data, ensure secure storage of passwords, and detect any unauthorized changes in a system. If a hash value changes, it indicates that the data has also been altered, which could suggest a security breach. Moreover, hash extraction can be used in forensics to track, identify, and analyze cyber threats.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Hash extraction can be implemented using various tools and techniques depending on the specific scenario. For example, in the context of password cracking, tools such as John the Ripper or Hashcat can be used to extract hashes from a system. The extracted hashes can then be compared with precomputed hashes of known passwords (a 'rainbow table') to identify matches. It is important to note that proper authorization and ethical guidelines should be followed when extracting hashes, especially in a live system due to the potential risks involved.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The practice of hash extraction has become increasingly important with the rise in cyber threats and the need for stronger data protection measures. It is commonly utilized in cybersecurity, digital forensics, and incident response.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Hash functions are a crucial aspect of modern computing, particularly in data security and encryption processes. They work by accepting an input‚Äîoften referred to as pre-image‚Äîand executing a set of mathematical operations to generate a unique output or hash value. The key property of a hash function is its determinism. This means for any given input, the output will always be the same, no matter how many times the hash function is applied.

The process of hashing is unidirectional. In other words, it's significantly challenging, if not impossible, to reverse-engineer the original input from the hash value, due to the complexity of the computations involved. This one-way property is vital for the secure storage of sensitive data, such as passwords. When a user sets up a password, rather than storing the actual password, the system will compute and store the hash value of the password. This way, even if someone gains access to the stored hashes, they cannot easily derive the original passwords.

When the user attempts to log in later, they provide their password again. The system runs the entered password through the same hash function, resulting in a hash value. The system then compares this value to the initially stored hash value associated with the account. If both hash values match, the system validates the password, and the user is granted access. If they don't match, access is denied, as it implies the entered password is incorrect.

The process of extracting these stored hash values is what is referred to as hash extraction. It forms a critical part of many cybersecurity operations, including digital forensics, incident response, and penetration testing. Extracting hashes allows cybersecurity professionals to verify data integrity, validate secure password storage, and identify unauthorized data alterations, among other things. However, hash extraction should be done ethically and responsibly, and typically requires proper authorization, especially when dealing with live systems. Using tools such as John the Ripper or Hashcat, professionals can extract hashes from a system for analysis or password cracking, where the hashes are compared with known hash-password combinations to find matches.

For example, imagine a cybersecurity professional conducting a penetration test on a system to ensure that password storage is secure. They have been given authorized access to perform this test.

One of the tools they might use for hash extraction is John the Ripper, a popular password-cracking tool. Let's say they are focusing on a Linux system where password hashes are typically stored in the /etc/shadow file.

Step 1: Using the command line, they would first need to gain access to the /etc/shadow file. This might look something like this:

```
sudo cat /etc/shadow

```

Step 2: This command would output a list of users and their associated password hashes, among other information. The output might look something like this:

```
root:$6$TRDyBHLk$rPn...SNIP...7/qp8SlKAk/:17555:0:99999:7:::

```

In this example, `$6$TRDyBHLk$rPn...SNIP...7/qp8SlKAk/` is the password hash for the root user.

Step 3: The cybersecurity professional would then use John the Ripper to attempt to crack this hash. The command might look something like this:

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

```

In this command, `--wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` refers to the list of precomputed hashes the professional is comparing against, and `hash.txt` is a file containing the extracted hash.

Step 4: If a match is found in the wordlist, John the Ripper will display the password associated with the hash.

Remember, this is a simplified example and actual hash extraction can be complex and requires proper authorization. The purpose of this example is to show how hash extraction can help in verifying secure password storage and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
