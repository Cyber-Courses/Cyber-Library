# GCP - API Keys Enum


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> GCP API Keys Enumeration is a technique to identify and validate the existing API keys in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). An API key is a simple encrypted string that identifies an application without any principal. They are used to track and control how the API is being used.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> API keys are crucial for security in any cloud platform, including GCP. However, if not properly managed, they can pose severe security risks. Unauthorized users can potentially gain access to sensitive data or services within your GCP environment. Therefore, understanding GCP API Keys Enumeration is important to ensure the security and integrity of your cloud resources.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> You can enumerate GCP API keys by using tools like Google's 'gcloud' command-line tool or other third-party tools. The basic steps include: 1. List all the projects in your GCP account. 2. For each project, list all the API keys. 3. For each API key, get details like its creation time, expiration time, and the services it can access. These steps will help you identify any unused or overly privileged API keys that should be revoked or restricted.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> GCP API Keys Enumeration should be used as a part of regular security audits or whenever a potential security breach is suspected. It can also be used in the initial setup phase to ensure that only necessary API keys are in use and are properly configured.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

GCP API Keys Enumeration is based on the principle of least privilege, which states that an entity should only have access to the resources it needs to perform its tasks and nothing more. This principle is fundamental to enhancing the security of your GCP resources. Through API Keys Enumeration, you can identify overly privileged API keys and take necessary actions to restrict their access. This process involves interacting with Google Cloud APIs and requires a thorough understanding of Google Cloud IAM, which is the identity and access management service in GCP. With IAM, you can set up roles and permissions for your API keys and control their access to your GCP resources.
