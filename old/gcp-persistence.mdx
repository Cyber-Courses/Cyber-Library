# GCP - Persistence


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Persistence refers to the various mechanisms provided by GCP to ensure that data is reliably stored and available even after a software or hardware failure. These mechanisms include replication, backup, and snapshotting services offered by GCP's storage and database solutions.


### 🧐 Why ?

Data persistence is a fundamental requirement for any application or system. It ensures that data remains intact and available even in the event of system failures, crashes, or restarts. In cloud environments like GCP, data persistence mechanisms are particularly important due to the distributed and dynamic nature of the infrastructure. They help to prevent data loss, ensure consistent application performance, and enable recovery capabilities.


### ⛏️ How ?

GCP provides several services and features for implementing data persistence. For example, Cloud SQL offers automatic backups and binary log replication for disaster recovery and high availability. Cloud Storage provides a highly durable storage service with built-in redundancy and automatic scaling. Persistent Disk offers block storage for Compute Engine and GKE instances, with snapshot capabilities for backup and replication. To use these services, you need to configure them according to your application's requirements and GCP's best practices.


### ⏳ When ?

Data persistence in GCP should be implemented from the very beginning of the system design and architecture planning stage. It's a crucial aspect of the application lifecycle that affects performance, reliability, and cost. Therefore, it's important to choose the right GCP services and configure them correctly based on your application's needs.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP provides several mechanisms for data persistence. For example, Persistent Disks attached to Compute Engine instances or GKE nodes are automatically replicated within the same zone. This ensures that data remains available even if one of the disks fails. Cloud SQL, GCP's managed relational database service, provides automated backups and binary log replication to ensure data durability and allow point-in-time recovery. Cloud Storage, GCP's object storage service, automatically replicates data across multiple geographically dispersed locations to provide high durability and availability. In addition, GCP offers services like Cloud Datastore and Cloud Bigtable that provide automatic replication and consistency controls for NoSQL databases. All these services use underlying infrastructure and protocols, such as Google's Colossus file system and Paxos consensus algorithm, to provide reliable data persistence.
