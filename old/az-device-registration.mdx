# Az - Device Registration


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Device Registration with Azure (Az) is a process that allows a device to be registered to a user and an organization within the Azure Active Directory (AD). This process is a part of Microsoft's identity and access management (IAM) solutions, and it is fundamental for managing and securing devices that access organizational resources.


### 🧐 Why ?

Device registration is important for several reasons. Firstly, it enables Conditional Access and Mobile Device Management (MDM) auto-enrollment, two key components of Microsoft's IAM. Conditional Access allows administrators to define policies that restrict access to organizational resources based on the state of the device. MDM auto-enrollment allows devices to be automatically enrolled for management with an MDM system like Intune. Secondly, device registration enables features like Enterprise State Roaming and Windows Hello for Business. Lastly, it can help with the device-based conditional access policy and provide a simplified user sign-in experience.


### ⛏️ How ?

To register a device in Azure AD, users typically follow these steps: 1. Sign in to the device using a work or school account. 2. Join the device to Azure AD. This can be done through the 'Access work or school' section in Windows settings. 3. Once the device is joined, it should appear in the Azure portal under 'Devices'. Administrators can then apply policies and manage the device as needed.


### ⏳ When ?

Device Registration with Azure became particularly relevant with the widespread adoption of cloud services and the increase in remote work, which necessitates robust and flexible IAM solutions. Microsoft continuously enhances this feature to meet the evolving needs of organizations.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Technically, when a device is registered with Azure AD, it's provided with a device identity. This identity is used to authenticate the device when it tries to access resources. The device identity is stored in the form of a device object in Azure AD, and this object is then associated with user objects. This association enables the aforementioned features like Conditional Access, MDM auto-enrollment, etc. It's worth noting that the device registration process varies slightly depending on the type of device (Windows, iOS, Android, etc.) and its ownership (personal or corporate).
