# GCP - Storage Privesc


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - Storage Privilege Escalation (Privesc) is a security concern where a user with limited access can escalate their privileges to gain unauthorized access to resources in GCP Storage.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding GCP Storage Privesc is crucial as it can lead to unauthorized data access, leading to data breaches. It's important for users and administrators to understand how to prevent this exploitation.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To prevent GCP Storage Privesc, administrators should follow best practices including least privilege principle, regular audits of IAM policies and roles, and use of organization policy constraints. Users should not share their credentials and should use two-factor authentication.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> GCP Storage Privesc became a concern as more organizations moved their data to cloud storage. The issue has become prevalent with the increasing use of GCP for cloud services.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

GCP Storage Privesc involves exploiting weaknesses in IAM roles and policies, allowing a user to gain unauthorized access. This can occur due to misconfigurations or weak security practices. An attacker can escalate their privileges by changing IAM policies, manipulating service accounts, or exploiting vulnerabilities in GCP services. By gaining higher-level access, they can access sensitive data, modify configurations, or disrupt services.
