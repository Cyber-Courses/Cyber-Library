# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Azure Blob Storage operates in the cloud, making it accessible from anywhere in the world. Data in Blob Storage is stored in containers, which act like directories in a file system. There are three types of blobs: Block blobs, Page blobs, and Append blobs. Block blobs are used for streaming and storing text and binary data, Page blobs are used for random access scenarios and Append blobs are optimized for append operations, making them ideal for logging scenarios. Blob Storage automatically replicates the data in your storage account to ensure durability and high availability.
