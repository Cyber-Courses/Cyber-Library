# 135, 593 - Pentesting MSRPC


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Pentesting MSRPC, or Microsoft Remote Procedure Call, refers to the process of testing the security of this network protocol. MSRPC is used by Windows operating systems to communicate with other devices, either on the same network or over the internet. It allows a program on one computer to execute code on a remote server, making it a potential target for cyber attacks.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> MSRPC is a critical component of many business networks, providing the necessary communication between different systems. However, its importance makes it a prime target for attackers. By exploiting vulnerabilities in MSRPC, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a network, execute malicious code, or even take over a system. Therefore, pentesting MSRPC is essential for identifying and addressing any security weaknesses and protecting the network from potential attacks.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Pentesting MSRPC typically involves several steps. First, the tester needs to identify the systems using MSRPC within the network. This can be done using a network scanner or similar tool. Once these systems are identified, the tester will try to exploit known vulnerabilities or find new ones. This often involves sending specially crafted requests to the MSRPC service and observing the response. If a vulnerability is found, the tester will then try to exploit it to gain unauthorized access or execute code on the remote system.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Pentesting MSRPC became more prevalent with the increase in cyber attacks targeting Windows' network services, which often exploit vulnerabilities in protocols like MSRPC. Regular penetration testing is now considered a best practice in cybersecurity, especially for networks that rely heavily on Windows systems.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

MSRPC operates over several different transport protocols, including TCP, UDP, and others. It uses an Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the data types and function prototypes for the remote procedures. During a pentest, testers will often use tools like Nmap or Nessus to scan for systems running MSRPC. They may also use Metasploit or similar frameworks to exploit known vulnerabilities. One common vulnerability is the MS03-026 buffer overflow, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. Other potential vulnerabilities include misconfigurations or weak security policies that allow unauthorized access to the MSRPC service.
