# GCP Pentesting


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP Pentesting refers to penetration testing activities carried out to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and applications.


### 🧐 Why ?

GCP Pentesting is critical to ensure the security of data and applications hosted on the GCP. As cloud services have become a primary target for attackers, it is essential to identify and remediate security weaknesses before they can be exploited.


### ⛏️ How ?

The process begins by identifying the target GCP resources. Then, using a combination of automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques, the penetration tester attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities. The tester also looks for potential weaknesses in the application's logic, configuration, and dependencies. Once vulnerabilities are identified, they are documented, and remediation steps are recommended.


### ⏳ When ?

GCP Pentesting started gaining traction with the growing adoption of cloud services. As organizations started moving their infrastructure to GCP, the need for specialized cloud penetration testing became evident.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Pentesting involves a range of techniques to exploit vulnerabilities. These include, but are not limited to, data injections, privilege escalation, session hijacking, and system exploitation. The tester may use tools such as Google's own Cloud Security Scanner, or third-party applications like OWASP ZAP and Nessus. These tools assist in identifying potential attack vectors such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and misconfigurations. The tester also manually inspects the system's configurations and code to identify vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss.
