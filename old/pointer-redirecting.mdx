# Pointer Redirecting


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Pointer redirecting, often referred to as pointer manipulation, is a core concept in computer programming. Essentially, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another value stored in memory. Redirecting a pointer means changing the memory address that the pointer is pointing to. This gives programmers direct access to memory cells, which allows for efficient, dynamic data structures.


### 🧐 Why ?

Knowing how to redirect pointers is fundamental to understanding how data is stored and manipulated in memory. It is particularly useful in situations where dynamic memory allocation is necessary, such as when dealing with arrays, linked lists, trees, and other data structures. Without the ability to manipulate pointers, building these complex structures would be much more difficult.


### ⛏️ How ?

To redirect a pointer, you simply need to assign a new memory address to the pointer. This can be done using the address-of operator (&) in C++. For example, if you have an int variable x and a pointer p, you can redirect p to point to x by using the statement p = &x. Now, any changes you make to *p will also affect x because they are both referring to the same memory location.


### ⏳ When ?

Pointer redirection has been a fundamental part of programming since the advent of languages like C and C++ in the 1970s and 1980s. Its usage has extended to other languages like Python and Java, though in a more abstracted form due to these languages' emphasis on safety and simplicity.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Pointer redirection, or pointer manipulation, is a key concept in computer programming languages such as C and C++. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. This memory address refers to the location in the computer's memory where the value of the variable is stored.

When a variable is declared in a program, the system allocates a certain amount of memory to store its value. Each byte of memory in a computer has a unique address, and the address of the first byte allocated for a variable is referred to as the 'address of the variable'.

Pointers give programmers direct access to these memory addresses and the ability to manipulate them. This is where the concept of 'redirecting' a pointer comes into play. When you redirect a pointer, you change the memory address it holds. This means the pointer, instead of pointing to one variable, now points to another. This has the effect of allowing the data at the new memory address to be accessed or altered through the pointer.

This capability is powerful in building complex data structures such as linked lists, trees, and others. For instance, in a linked list, each node contains a pointer that points to the next node. By manipulating these pointers, we can add, remove, or insert nodes in the list.

However, pointer manipulation needs to be handled carefully. Incorrect redirection can lead to bugs and crashes. This is because the program may attempt to access or modify memory that it should not, leading to undefined behavior.

In languages like Python and Java, pointer manipulation exists, but it's abstracted away to a large degree for the sake of safety and simplicity. In these languages, you work with references to objects rather than direct memory addresses.

Overall, understanding pointer redirecting is fundamental to understanding how data is stored and manipulated in memory, especially in languages where you have direct control over the memory, like C and C++.

Consider the following example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
    int* p = &x;  // p is a pointer to x

    cout << *p << endl;  // Outputs: 5

    p = &y;  // Redirecting p to point to y

    cout << *p << endl;  // Outputs: 10

    return 0;
}

```

Here's what's happening in each step:

1. We first create two integer variables, `x` and `y`, and assign them values 5 and 10 respectively.
2. We then create a pointer `p` and make it point to `x` by using the address-of operator `&`.
3. We use `cout` to print the value that `p` points to, which is `x`, so it outputs 5.
4. We then redirect the pointer `p` to `y` by assigning `p` the address of `y` using the statement `p = &y;`.
5. Next, we print the value that `p` points to again. This time, because `p` has been redirected to `y`, it outputs 10.

This simple example demonstrates the power of pointer redirection: we can use the same pointer `p` to manipulate different variables (`x` and `y`) at different times.

Remember, pointer redirection must be used with caution because incorrect usage can lead to bugs or crashes. Always make sure the memory you're pointing to is valid and that you have the necessary permissions to access or modify it.
