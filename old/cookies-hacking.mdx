# Cookies Hacking


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Cookies hacking, also known as cookie hijacking or session hijacking, is a type of web attack where an attacker intercepts and steals cookies from a user's web session. These cookies often contain sensitive information such as login credentials or personal data, making them a prime target for hackers.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding cookies hacking is crucial for both users and developers. For users, awareness of these attacks can lead to better practices in browsing security, such as regular session logouts and avoiding suspicious links. For developers, understanding these attacks can guide them in designing and implementing more secure web applications.


### ⛏️ How ?

Cookies hacking can be performed using a variety of methods. The most common method is through packet sniffing, where an attacker intercepts data packets as they are sent over a network. This can be done using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump. Another method is through cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker tricks a user's browser into running malicious code. This code can then be used to steal cookies.


### ⏳ When ?

Cookies hacking has been a prevalent issue since the early days of the internet. However, with the increased use of web applications for sensitive activities such as online banking and shopping, the severity and potential damage of these attacks have also increased.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

When a user logs into a website, the server generates a unique session ID for that user. This session ID is stored in a cookie on the user's device, and is sent back to the server with each subsequent request to verify the user's identity. In a cookie hijacking attack, an attacker intercepts these cookies and uses the stolen session ID to impersonate the user. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the network or the application, or by tricking the user into revealing their cookies through phishing or social engineering attacks.
