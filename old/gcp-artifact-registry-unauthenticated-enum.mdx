# GCP - Artifact Registry Unauthenticated Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP Artifact Registry Unauthenticated Enum refers to a security vulnerability in Google Cloud Platform's Artifact Registry. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the list of repositories and packages stored in the Artifact Registry.


### 🧐 Why ?

This vulnerability is important because it can result in information disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive data about an organization's software and infrastructure. This information can be used maliciously, for example, to exploit other vulnerabilities or launch sophisticated attacks. Thus, understanding this vulnerability and how to mitigate it is crucial for anyone using Google Cloud Platform's Artifact Registry.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use GCP Artifact Registry Unauthenticated Enum to your advantage, you would need to implement appropriate security measures. This could include configuring access controls to restrict who can view the list of repositories and packages, regularly monitoring for suspicious activity, and keeping up-to-date with the latest security updates and patches from Google Cloud Platform.


### ⏳ When ?

The GCP Artifact Registry Unauthenticated Enum vulnerability was first discovered in 2021, highlighting the ongoing security challenges faced in cloud computing. It serves as a reminder that even large and reputable cloud service providers like Google are not immune to security vulnerabilities.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Artifact Registry Unauthenticated Enum is a security vulnerability that arises due to insufficient access controls. In particular, it allows anyone to enumerate or list the repositories and packages stored in the Artifact Registry, without needing to authenticate or prove their identity. This is problematic because repositories and packages can contain sensitive information, such as the types of software an organization is using and their versions. Attackers can exploit this information to identify potential vulnerabilities and launch targeted attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, organizations should configure access controls to limit who can view their repositories and packages. They should also monitor for suspicious activity, such as attempts to enumerate their repositories and packages, and respond promptly if they detect any.
