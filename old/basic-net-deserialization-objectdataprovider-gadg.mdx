# Basic .Net deserialization (ObjectDataProvider gadget, ExpandedWrapper, and Json.Net)


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Basic .Net deserialization is a process in which object data in .Net that has been serialized into a stream of bytes is read back from the stream and reconstructed into .Net objects. It uses various gadgets such as ObjectDataProvider, ExpandedWrapper, and Json.Net for this purpose.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Basic .Net deserialization is important because it allows data to be easily stored and transferred in a format that can be easily understood and used by .Net applications. Without deserialization, it would be impossible to restore the state of an object once it has been serialized. This is particularly important in cases where data needs to be sent over a network or stored in a database.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use Basic .Net deserialization, you need to first serialize your object into a byte stream using a serialization method. Once you have your serialized data, you can then use a deserialization method to convert the byte stream back into a .Net object. For example, you could use the ObjectDataProvider gadget to deserialize data that was previously serialized using the BinaryFormatter.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Basic .Net deserialization has been used since the introduction of .Net framework by Microsoft. Its implementation and usage have evolved over time with the introduction of various gadgets and libraries like Json.Net that have made the process more efficient and secure.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Basic .Net deserialization involves reading a stream of bytes that represents an object's data, and then using that data to recreate the object. This process can be done with various gadgets such as ObjectDataProvider, which is commonly used with BinaryFormatter, and Json.Net, which is a popular library for handling JSON data. When the data is deserialized, it is read from the byte stream in the same order that it was written during serialization. This allows the object's state to be accurately reconstructed. However, deserialization can pose security risks if not handled properly, as it can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive data. Therefore, it's important to use secure deserialization methods and validate all deserialized data before use.
