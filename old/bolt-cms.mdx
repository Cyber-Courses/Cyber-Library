# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Bolt CMS is a content management system that is built on the Silex microframework and uses Twig for its templates. Silex is a PHP microframework that is based on Symfony components and provides a concise and extensible base for web applications. Twig is a template engine for PHP that provides a flexible, fast, and secure way to generate HTML output.

The core feature of Bolt CMS is its use of a flat-file database by default, but it can be configured to use MySQL or SQLite if needed. Flat-file databases are simple database systems that store data in a plain text file. This design decision makes Bolt CMS lightweight and fast, as it doesn't require a separate database server for most use cases. If a more robust database solution is needed, Bolt CMS can be configured to use MySQL or SQLite, which are more traditional relational database management systems.

Bolt CMS also subscribes to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The MVC architecture is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model, which represents the data and the rules that govern access to and updates of this data; the View, which is the user interface and displays the data; and the Controller, which manages the input from the user.

Another key feature of Bolt CMS is its support for responsive design. Responsive design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. This feature is increasingly important in today's multi-device world.

Finally, Bolt CMS includes a feature called 'ContentTypes', which allows users to define custom content types with custom fields. This feature provides a great deal of flexibility for managing diverse types of content on a website. For example, a user could define a 'Product' ContentType with custom fields for price, weight, and manufacturer.

Let's take the example of creating a new ContentType in Bolt CMS; we'll create a 'Product' ContentType with custom fields for price, weight, and manufacturer.

Firstly, you need to navigate to the `contenttypes.yaml` file in your Bolt CMS configuration files. The `contenttypes.yaml` file is where all the ContentTypes in your Bolt CMS installation are defined.

Here's how you could define a 'Product' ContentType:

```yaml
products:
    name: Products
    singular_name: Product
    fields:
        title:
            type: text
            class: large
        slug:
            type: slug
            uses: title
        price:
            type: float
        weight:
            type: float
        manufacturer:
            type: text
    default_status: published

```

In this YAML configuration:

- `products` is the key for this ContentType. It's used internally by Bolt CMS.
- `name` and `singular_name` are used to display in the Bolt CMS backend.
- `fields` defines the fields for this ContentType. Here we have `title`, `slug`, `price`, `weight`, and `manufacturer`. For `price` and `weight`, we're using a `float` type to allow decimal values.
- `default_status` is set to 'published', meaning new entries of this ContentType will be published by default.

Save the `contenttypes.yaml` file and the new ContentType will be available in your Bolt CMS backend. You can now create new 'Product' entries with fields for price, weight, and manufacturer.
