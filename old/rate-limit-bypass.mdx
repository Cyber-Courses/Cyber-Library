# Rate Limit Bypass


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Rate Limit Bypass is a technique widely used in penetration testing where the attacker tries to bypass the restrictions placed by the rate limit rules in an application to perform unauthorized actions. It is a type of cyber-attack which takes advantage of the fact that rate limiting rules are not properly implemented in a system or application.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding Rate Limit Bypass is crucial because it exposes the weaknesses in the implementation of rate limiting rules. If not properly addressed, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform actions like brute force attacks, DDoS attacks, or even creating numerous spam accounts. Therefore, it's important for our readers, especially those in the cybersecurity field, to understand this concept as a measure to prevent such attacks.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To implement Rate Limit Bypass, an attacker would typically try different methods such as changing the IP address, changing the User-Agent in HTTP requests, or using other evasion techniques to bypass the restrictions. On the defensive side, implementing proper rate limiting rules, monitoring system logs, and using advanced detection techniques can help in mitigating such attacks.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The practice of Rate Limit Bypass began with the advent of rate limiting rules in applications. As applications started implementing these rules to prevent abuse, attackers found ways to bypass these restrictions leading to the growth of this technique.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Rate Limit Bypass is a technique that exploits poor implementation of rate limiting rules in a system. Rate limiting is a technique for limiting network traffic. It sets a limit on how many requests a client can make to a server in a certain amount of time. The goal is to control the amount of traffic to the server, preventing it from being overwhelmed. However, if the rate limiting rules are not properly implemented, an attacker can bypass these restrictions by using different evasion techniques. For instance, an attacker can change the IP address from which the requests are coming, or the User-Agent in the HTTP requests. This can allow the attacker to send more requests than allowed by the rate limit rules, leading to potential attacks such as brute force or DDoS attacks.
