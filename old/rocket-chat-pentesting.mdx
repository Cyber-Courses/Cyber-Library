# Rocket Chat pentesting


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Rocket Chat pentesting involves conducting a simulated cyber attack on a Rocket Chat system to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers. Rocket Chat is a popular open-source team chat software platform that provides teams with the tools they need to collaborate. It's used by many businesses and organizations for team communication and collaboration.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Pentesting is crucial because it helps identify potential vulnerabilities in a system before a malicious actor has the chance to exploit them. In the context of Rocket Chat, pentesting can help uncover issues that could lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and other serious security incidents. Given the widespread use of Rocket Chat in corporate environments, such vulnerabilities could have significant repercussions.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Rocket Chat pentesting typically involves several steps. First, the pentester will identify the system's vulnerabilities using various tools and techniques. This could involve inspecting the code, conducting a vulnerability scan, or even attempting to exploit known vulnerabilities. Once the vulnerabilities have been identified, the pentester will then attempt to exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. Finally, the pentester will document their findings and provide recommendations for mitigating the identified risks.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Pentesting should be conducted regularly to ensure ongoing security. This is especially true for Rocket Chat systems, which are often targeted by hackers due to their widespread use. Ideally, a pentest should be conducted before the system is deployed, and then regularly throughout its lifecycle.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Rocket Chat pentesting is a comprehensive process used to identify and assess potential security vulnerabilities within the Rocket Chat platform. This is achieved through a variety of techniques.

Firstly, the process may involve a code review where the pentester meticulously scrutinizes the source code of the Rocket Chat software. This is done to pinpoint any coding flaws or oversights that could potentially be exploited by an attacker. This process can be quite labor-intensive, but it's essential as it allows for the detection of any inherent weaknesses in the code that could introduce vulnerabilities.

Another key technique used in Rocket Chat pentesting is the use of vulnerability scanning tools. These are specialized software that can scan the system for known vulnerabilities. These tools work by comparing the system against a database of known vulnerabilities and alerting the pentester if any matches are found. This approach is highly efficient as it allows for the rapid identification of known vulnerabilities without requiring manual code review.

Once potential vulnerabilities have been identified through code review and vulnerability scanning, the next step involves exploitation. In this stage, the pentester attempts to exploit the identified vulnerabilities either manually or using automated tools. The goal here isn't to cause harm, but to confirm the existence of the vulnerability and understand its potential impact. By successfully exploiting a vulnerability, the pentester can demonstrate how an attacker could potentially compromise the system.

It's important to note that Rocket Chat pentesting should be an ongoing process. As new updates and features are added to the Rocket Chat software, new vulnerabilities may be introduced, making regular pentesting crucial for maintaining the security of the system.

In conclusion, Rocket Chat pentesting is a vital security practice that involves a blend of manual and automated techniques to identify, verify, and assess potential vulnerabilities within the Rocket Chat platform. It forms a critical part of any organization's cybersecurity strategy, helping to safeguard against potential attacks and data breaches.

An example of a real but educational Rocket Chat pentesting scenario could go as follows:

**1. Code Review:**
Imagine that we're examining the Rocket Chat source code and we come across the following code snippet:

```jsx
app.post('/login', function(req, res){
    var username = req.body.username;
    var password = req.body.password;
    if(username == db.username && password == db.password){
        res.redirect('/dashboard');
    } else {
        res.redirect('/login');
    }
});

```

This code is responsible for handling user login. However, it's flawed because it directly compares the input with stored values without any form of encryption or hashing. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker through a brute force attack.

**2. Vulnerability Scanning:**
Next, we use a vulnerability scanning tool like Nessus to scan the system. The tool might output something like this:

```bash
- [!] Vulnerability found: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- [!] Vulnerability found: SQL Injection

```

This indicates that the system is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection attacks.

**3. Exploitation:**
Now, let's confirm the existence of the reported vulnerabilities by attempting to exploit them. For instance, we could use an XSS payload to test for the XSS vulnerability:

```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>

```

If an alert box pops up when we input this into a form field, it confirms the XSS vulnerability.

**4. Mitigation:**
After confirming the vulnerabilities, we would recommend remedial actions. For the flawed login code, we'd recommend implementing a secure password hashing mechanism. For the XSS vulnerability, we'd recommend sanitizing user inputs.

This example is purely illustrative. Real-world scenarios would involve numerous such reviews, scans, and exploitations, and the mitigation steps would be far more complex.
