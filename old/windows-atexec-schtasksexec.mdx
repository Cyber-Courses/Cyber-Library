# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Windows AtExec and SchtasksExec are functionalities in Microsoft‚Äôs Windows operating system that allow for task scheduling and execution. They are integral parts of the Windows Task Scheduler, a system tool that enables users to create and manage common tasks that their computer will carry out automatically at predetermined times.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding how Windows AtExec and SchtasksExec work is crucial to both system administrators and cybersecurity professionals. For administrators, these tools offer a way to automate routine tasks, such as software updates or system backups, thereby improving efficiency and productivity. For cybersecurity professionals, these tools can represent potential vulnerabilities if not properly secured, as they could be exploited by attackers to execute malicious tasks.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use Windows AtExec or SchtasksExec, you first need to access the Task Scheduler. This can be done by searching for 'Task Scheduler' in the start menu. Once you've opened the tool, you can create a new task by clicking on 'Create Basic Task' or 'Create Task'. You'll then be guided through the process of setting up the task, including defining the task's triggers (when it will run), actions (what it will do), and conditions (under what circumstances it will do it).
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The use of Windows AtExec and SchtasksExec became widely practiced with the release of Windows XP and has been a part of every subsequent version of Windows. Over time, these tools have been enhanced and refined to offer more robust task scheduling and execution capabilities.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Windows AtExec and SchtasksExec are integral parts of the Windows Task Scheduler, a tool that allows the automation of tasks in Microsoft's Windows operating systems. These tasks are scheduled to execute at specific times or under certain conditions.

On a technical level, these functions work by interacting with the Windows Task Scheduler service that continuously runs in the background of your system. This service is responsible for monitoring the conditions specified in each task. These conditions can be a specific time, system event, or a wide variety of triggers.

When the conditions outlined in a task are met, the Task Scheduler service will then execute the task's actions. These actions can vary widely depending on what the task is intended to do. They can include launching a specific program or application, sending an email, or even displaying a message to the user.

The tasks themselves are stored on the system as .job files. These files contain the specifications for each task, including its triggers (when the task will run), actions (what the task will do once it's triggered), and conditions (under what specific circumstances the task will trigger). It's these .job files that the Task Scheduler service is constantly monitoring.

The Windows Task Scheduler, and by extension the AtExec and SchtasksExec functions, have been a part of Windows operating systems since the release of Windows XP. Over the years, Microsoft has refined and expanded these tools, adding new features and capabilities to provide users with a more robust and versatile task scheduling and execution solution.

Here's a detailed example of how to use SchtasksExec to create a task that opens Notepad at a specific time:

1. Open `Command Prompt` by searching for it in the start menu.
2. To create a task that opens Notepad every day at 1 PM, you would type the following command:
    
    ```
    schtasks /create /sc daily /tn "OpenNotepad" /tr "notepad.exe" /st 13:00
    
    ```
    
    Let's break down this command:
    
    - `/create` is used to indicate that we're creating a new task.
    - `/sc daily` sets the schedule to daily. You could also use `weekly`, `monthly`, etc.
    - `/tn "OpenNotepad"` names the task "OpenNotepad". You can choose any name you like.
    - `/tr "notepad.exe"` sets the task to run `notepad.exe`, which opens Notepad. This could be any executable file on your computer.
    - `/st 13:00` sets the start time to 1 PM (13:00 in 24-hour time).
3. Press `Enter` to create the task.

Now, the Task Scheduler service will monitor the system, and when the clock hits 1 PM, it will execute the `OpenNotepad` task and open Notepad. This task will be stored as a `.job` file in the system, and will run daily unless it's deleted or disabled.

Remember: It's important to run `Command Prompt` as an administrator when creating tasks. If you don't, you may not have the necessary permissions to create tasks.
