# MySQL injection


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

MySQL injection is a code injection technique that attackers use to exploit the vulnerabilities in a web application's database layer. This technique often involves inserting malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution, leading to information disclosure.


### 🧐 Why ?

MySQL injection is a critical security issue because it can allow an attacker to view, modify, and delete the data in a database, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. Understanding MySQL injection is important for developers and security professionals to build secure applications and implement effective security measures.


### ⛏️ How ?

To prevent MySQL injection, use prepared statements with parameterized queries, use stored procedures, escape all user-supplied input, and limit the privileges of database accounts. Also, regularly update and patch your database systems.


### ⏳ When ?

MySQL injection started to be heavily used by attackers in the early 2000s as web applications became more prevalent. Despite the knowledge of this attack technique, it continues to be a common vulnerability in web applications even today.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At its core, a MySQL injection attack involves the input of SQL queries by manipulating the data input into a vulnerable web application. The attacker can insert a payload that is part of an SQL query, which alters the course of execution of the following SQL query. By successfully altering the SQL query, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands in the database, potentially leading to data exposure or even remote code execution.
