# GCP - Memorystore Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Memorystore for Redis is a fully managed in-memory data store service built on Google Cloud. It offers a seamless, secure, and scalable solution for applications that require a highly available and fast data store. The service supports both Redis and Memcached protocols and provides automatic failover, replication, and patching capabilities.


### 🧐 Why ?

In-memory data stores like Memorystore are essential for applications that require low-latency and high-throughput access to data. These stores are used for various purposes, such as caching, session storage, real-time analytics and prediction, and message brokering. However, managing such data stores can be complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Memorystore addresses these challenges by providing a fully managed service that automates complex administrative tasks such as hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, failure recovery, software patching, and scaling. Its integration with Google Cloud's networking, identity, and access management services also ensures a secure and compliant data store environment.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use Memorystore, you first need to create a Memorystore instance in the Google Cloud Console or using the gcloud command-line tool. Once the instance is created, you can connect to it using a Redis or Memcached client. You can then start storing and retrieving data in the instance. Memorystore also provides metrics and logs that you can use to monitor the performance and health of your instances.


### ⏳ When ?

Google Cloud introduced Memorystore in May 2018 as part of its suite of fully managed database services.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Memorystore for Redis is built on Google Cloud's highly reliable and low-latency network infrastructure. It uses the Redis in-memory data structure store, which supports various data types such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Memorystore automatically handles tasks like provisioning, replication, failover, backups, and scaling, thereby freeing developers from the operational complexities of managing a data store. The service also ensures high availability and durability of data by replicating it across multiple zones in a region. Furthermore, Memorystore integrates with Google Cloud's VPC networking, allowing you to securely connect your applications to Memorystore instances without exposing them to the internet. It also supports Google Cloud's IAM for access control, and Cloud Audit Logs for auditing.
