# GCP - Unauthenticated Enum & Access


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Unauthenticated Enum & Access refers to a security vulnerability where an attacker can enumerate and access unauthenticated resources in your GCP environment. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and potential disruption of your services.


### 🧐 Why ?

This vulnerability is critical because it can lead to severe data breaches and service disruption. It exposes your organization to potential financial losses, reputational damage, and legal issues. Therefore, understanding and mitigating this security issue should be a high priority for any organization using GCP.


### ⛏️ How ?

To implement GCP Unauthenticated Enum & Access, an attacker would typically use automated tools to discover and access unauthenticated resources. This can be prevented by enforcing strict access control policies, regularly reviewing and updating these policies, and using tools to monitor for any unauthorized access attempts. It is also recommended to use encryption for data at rest and in transit, and to regularly audit your GCP environment for any potential vulnerabilities.


### ⏳ When ?

This vulnerability has been known and exploited by attackers for several years. It became more prevalent with the increasing adoption of cloud services and the growing sophistication of cyber attack tools and techniques.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Unauthenticated Enum & Access involves two main steps: enumeration and access. Enumeration is the process of identifying resources in a GCP environment, such as storage buckets or virtual machines. An attacker can use various methods for enumeration, including scanning for open ports, analyzing DNS records, or using Google's own APIs. Once the resources have been enumerated, the attacker can then attempt to access them. If these resources are not properly secured, for example, if they do not require authentication or if their access control policies are too permissive, the attacker can gain unauthorized access. This can lead to various harmful outcomes, such as data theft, service disruption, or even a full takeover of the GCP environment.
