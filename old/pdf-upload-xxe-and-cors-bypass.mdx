# PDF Upload - XXE and CORS bypass


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> PDF upload refers to the process of uploading a PDF file to a server. XXE (XML External Entity) refers to a type of attack that exploits a vulnerability in an application's processing of XML input. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) bypass refers to techniques used to circumvent the security restrictions imposed by the CORS policy.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding PDF upload, XXE, and CORS bypass is important because these concepts are central to web application security. Exploiting PDF upload can lead to a variety of security issues, including unauthorized access to sensitive data. XXE attacks can lead to disclosure of internal files, denial of service, and remote code execution. CORS bypass can allow an attacker to interact with a resource from a different origin, violating the same-origin policy.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To prevent PDF upload exploitation, it's important to validate the file type and content before uploading it to the server. XXE attacks can be mitigated by disabling external entity references in XML parsers or using less complex data formats such as JSON. CORS policies should be properly configured to only allow trusted origins. Regularly scanning and patching vulnerabilities can also help enhance security.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The practice of exploiting PDF upload, XXE, and CORS has been around for quite some time, as long as these technologies and their vulnerabilities have existed. It's crucial for web developers and security professionals to stay up-to-date with the latest techniques and mitigation strategies.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

PDF upload exploitation often involves uploading a malicious PDF that contains scripts to execute arbitrary code or perform other unwanted actions. XXE attacks exploit the fact that XML parsers typically allow specification of an external entity; an attacker can use this feature to read sensitive files on the server, interact with internal systems, or execute code. CORS bypass techniques usually involve exploiting misconfigurations in the CORS policy, which is intended to restrict which origins can interact with a resource.
