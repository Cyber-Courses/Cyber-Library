# Pentesting Wifi


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Pentesting Wifi, or wireless penetration testing, is a method used by cybersecurity experts to assess and strengthen the security of a wireless network. In essence, it's a simulated attack on the system to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Wireless networks are ubiquitous today, and they often become the weakest link in the security chain. They are an attractive target for attackers due to their inherent vulnerabilities such as weak encryption, easy accessibility and poor configuration. Therefore, understanding and implementing Wifi pentesting is crucial for maintaining robust network security.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Step 1: Reconnaissance - Scan the environment to identify available networks. Step 2: Network Mapping - Understand how the network is structured. Step 3: Vulnerability Scan - Use tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to identify potential vulnerabilities. Step 4: Exploitation - Attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities. Step 5: Post-Exploitation - Determine the level of access gained and what malicious actions can be performed. Step 6: Reporting - Document the findings and propose solutions.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Wireless penetration testing started gaining popularity with the wider adoption of wireless networks, around the mid-2000s. However, with the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, it has become a best practice in the cybersecurity industry.

Wireless penetration testing is a comprehensive process that entails a sequence of steps, all aimed at delving deeper into the security framework of the network being tested. The process begins with Reconnaissance, where the tester scans the environment to identify available networks. The next step, Network Mapping, involves understanding the structure of the network to gain insights into potential points of vulnerability.

Following the mapping, a Vulnerability Scan is conducted using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS. These tools help to identify potential weak spots in the network's security that could be exploited. Once the vulnerabilities are identified, the next phase, Exploitation, begins. In this phase, the tester mimics the actions of a malicious hacker and attempts to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the network.

The fifth step is Post-Exploitation, where the tester assesses the level of access gained through the exploitation and determines what malicious actions can be performed. This step is crucial in understanding the potential damage that could be inflicted if a real attacker were to exploit the same vulnerabilities.

Finally, the tester moves on to Reporting. In this phase, the findings from the test are documented and solutions to rectify the identified vulnerabilities are proposed. This report serves as a blueprint for improving the network's security, allowing organizations to stay ahead of potential threats and prevent security breaches.

Thus, wireless penetration testing is not merely an attack simulation, but a thorough and methodical process that helps organizations identify and address vulnerabilities in their network security, ultimately enhancing their overall cybersecurity posture.

For instance, consider a scenario where we are testing the security of a network named "TestNet". Here are the steps:

1. **Reconnaissance:** Use the command `sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon` to monitor all nearby wireless networks. This command will list all available networks, including "TestNet".
2. **Network Mapping:** With `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24`, we can discover all devices within the "TestNet" network range. This will help understand the network structure.
3. **Vulnerability Scan:** Use a tool like Nessus. After installing and starting Nessus, navigate to "[https://localhost:8834/](https://localhost:8834/)" in a web browser and set up a new scan targeting the IP range discovered in the Network Mapping phase. The scan results will show potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Exploitation:** Suppose Nessus identified "TestNet" is vulnerable to a known WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) flaw. We can use a tool like Reaver with the command `reaver -i wlan0mon -b [BSSID] -vv -K 1`, replacing `[BSSID]` with the BSSID of "TestNet", to exploit the vulnerability.
5. **Post-Exploitation:** After gaining access, we evaluate what can be done. For example, with the `netstat -tuln` command, we can see all open ports and potentially vulnerable services on the network.
6. **Reporting:** Compile all findings, potential threats, executed commands, and proposed solutions into a comprehensive report. This report might include suggestions such as updating the firmware, disabling WPS, or changing the network password to improve "TestNet" security.

Remember, this example is a simplified scenario for illustrative purposes and actual penetration testing processes can be far more complex and should only be done by authorized professionals.
