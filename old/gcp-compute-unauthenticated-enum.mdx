# GCP - Compute Unauthenticated Enum


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> GCP Compute Unauthenticated Enumeration, often referred to as Compute Unauth Enum, is a security concept pertaining to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It involves the process of discovering and listing resources that are accessible without authentication on GCP's Compute Engine. This can include virtual machines, disks, snapshots, images, and other resources. It is a crucial topic for both penetration testers and cloud security professionals.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding Compute Unauthenticated Enumeration is essential for maintaining security on the Google Cloud Platform. Unauthorized users can exploit this to gain information about your cloud infrastructure and resources, potentially leading to more serious security breaches. This can include retrieving metadata information, obtaining virtual machine details, or even accessing sensitive data. Therefore, it's vital for security teams to understand this concept to effectively secure their cloud resources.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To implement Compute Unauthenticated Enumeration, one can use tools like Google's 'gcloud' command-line interface or third-party tools designed for GCP enumeration. The process generally involves scanning the public IP addresses associated with a GCP project and attempting to access various resources. However, to prevent unauthenticated enumeration, it's recommended to follow Google's best practices for securing Compute Engine resources, such as limiting public IP usage, restricting API access, and regularly auditing your security settings.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The use of Compute Unauthenticated Enumeration started gaining traction as more organizations adopted cloud services and the need for effective cloud security practices increased. It's especially relevant in today's environment where cloud resources are often targeted by cyber criminals.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

At a technical level, Compute Unauthenticated Enumeration involves sending requests to the metadata server of the Google Compute Engine. This server contains information about the instance that can be accessed without needing to authenticate. The metadata includes details about the service accounts, network configurations, SSH keys, and more. An attacker can send a GET request to the metadata server's URL to retrieve this information. However, Google has implemented measures to prevent this by requiring a special header ('Metadata-Flavor: Google') in the request. Still, misconfigurations or oversights can lead to potential leaks of information.
