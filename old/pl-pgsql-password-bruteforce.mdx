# PL/pgSQL Password Bruteforce


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

PL/pgSQL Password Bruteforce is a technique used to discover passwords in a PostgreSQL database. It is based on the PL/pgSQL procedural language in PostgreSQL.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding PL/pgSQL Password Bruteforce is crucial because it is a common attack vector in cyberspace. This technique poses a significant threat as it can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. As such, anyone interested in cybersecurity, especially database administrators and security professionals, should be familiar with this concept to better protect their databases.


### ⛏️ How ?

PL/pgSQL Password Bruteforce can be implemented by iterating through all possible password combinations until the correct one is found. This is typically done with the help of software tools designed for this purpose. However, note that this is an illegal activity unless you have explicit permission to perform such an action on the targeted database.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of bruteforce techniques, including PL/pgSQL Password Bruteforce, became prominent with the rise of automated tools and increased computing power, which significantly reduced the time required to crack passwords.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a high level, PL/pgSQL Password Bruteforce involves systematically checking all possible passwords until the correct one is found. For a password of length 'n', using a dictionary of 'd' possible characters, there are 'd^n' possible passwords. A bruteforce attack iteratively checks these possibilities until it finds a match. The efficiency of such an attack depends on several factors, including password length, complexity, and the computing power available to the attacker. To defend against such attacks, it is recommended to use strong, unique passwords, limit login attempts, and implement other security measures such as two-factor authentication.
