# 1723 - Pentesting PPTP


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> 1723 - Pentesting PPTP refers to the process of testing the security of Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), a method used to implement Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). PPTP encapsulates data packets within an IP wrapper and sends them over a network.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> PPTP is widely used for creating VPNs due to its simplicity and compatibility with various platforms. However, its security has been a subject of debate, with several known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Therefore, pentesting PPTP is crucial to identify security weaknesses and mitigate potential threats.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Pentesting PPTP involves various steps. First, the pentester needs to identify the presence of PPTP, typically running on TCP port 1723. Various tools like Nmap can be used for this purpose. Next, they may attempt to exploit known PPTP vulnerabilities, such as MS-CHAPv2 weaknesses or issues with its encryption algorithm. Tools such as 'chapcrack' and 'asleap' can be used in this stage. Finally, the pentester documents the findings and provides recommendations to improve security.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Pentesting PPTP or any other protocol should be done periodically, especially when changes are made to the network infrastructure. It began being practiced as early as when PPTP was introduced in 1999 due to its known vulnerabilities.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a method used to implement Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). It creates a tunnel for data packets, which are encapsulated within an IP wrapper. This encapsulation does not inherently secure the data; instead, PPTP relies on Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to encrypt the data before encapsulation.

The encryption within PPTP is done using Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE). MPPE uses the RC4 cipher for encryption, which is considered relatively weak and known to have several vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited by attackers, compromising the data transmitted via the PPTP VPN.

In terms of authentication, PPTP uses Microsoft's Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAPv2). MS-CHAPv2 has been widely criticized for its security weaknesses, which further contributes to the potential vulnerabilities within PPTP.

Due to these known weaknesses, it is crucial to conduct regular penetration testing (pentesting) on PPTP VPNs. Pentesting serves to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities, providing a clear picture of potential security risks. A successful pentest can expose these vulnerabilities, allowing for appropriate security measures to be implemented to mitigate potential threats.

Pentesting PPTP involves several steps. Initially, the presence of PPTP, typically running on TCP port 1723, is identified. Tools like Nmap can be used for this purpose. Once the presence of PPTP has been confirmed, pentesters may attempt to exploit known PPTP vulnerabilities. Tools such as 'chapcrack' and 'asleap' can be used to exploit weaknesses in MS-CHAPv2 or the RC4 cipher used in MPPE. The findings from the pentest are then documented, and recommendations for improving security are provided.

Here is an example of the pentesting process for PPTP:

Step 1: Identify the presence of PPTP.
To identify whether PPTP is running, you can use a tool like Nmap. The command would look like this:

```bash
nmap -p 1723 target_ip

```

In this command, `-p 1723` specifies the port number for PPTP, and `target_ip` should be replaced with the IP address of the system you are testing. If PPTP is running, Nmap should return a response indicating that port 1723 is open.

Step 2: Exploit known vulnerabilities.
Once you have confirmed the presence of PPTP, you can attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities. For instance, you could use a tool like 'chapcrack' to exploit weaknesses in MS-CHAPv2. A basic chapcrack command looks like this:

```bash
chapcrack -i capture.pcap

```

In this command, `-i` specifies the input file, `capture.pcap` is a packet capture file containing the MS-CHAPv2 handshake. Chapcrack will parse this handshake to obtain the necessary data for cracking the password.

Step 3: Document findings and provide recommendations.
After the pentest, it's important to document all findings. This will typically include the vulnerabilities identified, the potential impact, and recommended actions for mitigating these vulnerabilities. For instance, if the pentest revealed weaknesses in MS-CHAPv2, one recommendation might be to switch to a more secure protocol.
