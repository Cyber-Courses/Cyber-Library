# External Recon Methodology


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> External Recon Methodology is the process of collecting information about a target system from publicly available resources. It is typically the first phase of a penetration testing process where an attacker learns about the target system, its network, and potential security vulnerabilities.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> External Recon Methodology is vital for identifying potential weaknesses in a system's security. It helps in planning the attack vector and understanding the target system's vulnerabilities. This process is not only relevant for malicious attackers but also for IT professionals who want to secure their systems against potential threats.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> The methodology typically involves gathering information about the target through WHOIS databases, DNS records, search engines, and social media. Techniques such as network scanning, port scanning, OS fingerprinting, and service detection are used. The information gathered in this phase can be used to map out the network and identify potential vulnerabilities.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The practice of External Recon Methodology started in the early days of internet and networking, where systems started becoming interconnected. Over time, as systems became more complex and the internet expanded, the importance and complexity of the methodology increased.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

The External Recon Methodology is centered around the principle of information gathering. It is a structured process used to collect, analyze, and utilize information about a target system, typically in the context of cyber security and penetration testing.

The process commences with the identification of the target's IP address range, domain names, and network topology. These details are essential in understanding the structure of the target's network and can be obtained by querying public databases or utilizing network scanning tools such as Nmap.

Following this, the vulnerabilities of the system are identified. This involves a deep dive into the system's configuration, services, and any potential weak points that could be exploited. Tools like Nessus or OpenVAS are often employed for this purpose, providing a detailed analysis of the system's security status and exposing any potential vulnerabilities.

The final step in the External Recon Methodology involves using all the gathered information to plan and execute an attack. This could involve exploiting identified vulnerabilities or taking advantage of weak points in the system's configuration.

The core principle in successful reconnaissance is patience and thoroughness. Each piece of information obtained, regardless of how insignificant it may initially seem, could provide crucial insights into the target's security posture. For instance, an overlooked configuration detail could lead to a significant security vulnerability. Therefore, a systematic, patient, and comprehensive approach is key in the External Recon Methodology.

Let's consider an example of an external recon process on a hypothetical target. For this example, let's assume we are performing a penetration test on `example.com`.

**Step 1: Gathering Information about the Target**

We start by identifying the IP address range and domain names. This can be done using the `nslookup` command in the terminal.

```bash
nslookup example.com

```

This command provides us the IP address associated with `example.com`.

**Step 2: Network Scanning**

Next, we perform a network scan using a tool such as Nmap. This tool can provide further information about the target's network.

```bash
nmap -v -A <IP address from nslookup>

```

This command will give us detailed information about the open ports, services running on those ports, the operating system, and other potential vulnerabilities.

**Step 3: Identifying Vulnerabilities**

Let's assume that Nmap identified an open port, say 22 (SSH). To further explore potential vulnerabilities, we can use a tool like Nessus.

```bash
# Assuming Nessus is already installed and properly configured
nessus --scan <IP address>:22

```

Nessus will provide a detailed report about potential vulnerabilities associated with the SSH service running on port 22.

**Step 4: Planning and Executing an Attack**

Based on the vulnerabilities identified, we can plan our attack. For instance, if Nessus identified a weak SSH password as a vulnerability, we can use a tool like Hydra to perform a brute force attack.

```bash
hydra -l root -P /path/to/password/list -vV -t 4 -u <IP address> ssh

```

In this example, we used Hydra to try to brute force the SSH password for the `root` user. The `-P` argument is used to specify the path to a list of potential passwords.

Remember, the success of the recon process lies in being patient and thorough. Each piece of information can provide crucial insights into the target's security posture.
