# GCP - Non-svc Persistance


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform's Non-service Persistance is a feature of the platform that allows data to persist beyond the lifecycle of individual service instances. This is achieved through the use of storage services like Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and Persistent Disks, which provide durable and highly available storage for your data.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding Non-service Persistence in GCP is crucial because it allows you to design and implement solutions that are resilient and durable. In a cloud environment, instances of services can be transient which means data can be lost when they are terminated. With Non-service Persistence, you can ensure that your data will survive beyond the lifecycle of your service instances, which is essential for applications that require data durability and high availability.


### ⛏️ How ?

To take advantage of Non-service Persistence in GCP, you can use one of the many storage solutions provided by the platform. For example, you can use Cloud Storage for storing and retrieving unstructured data, Cloud SQL for relational data, and Persistent Disks for block storage. When creating these resources, make sure to configure them with the right durability and availability options to meet your application's requirements.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of Non-service Persistence in cloud computing became prominent with the advent of scalable and distributed systems. This approach has been a fundamental part of GCP since its inception, providing solutions for data durability and high availability.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

In the GCP ecosystem, Non-service Persistence is achieved through the use of various storage services. These services provide a way to store data that is not tied to the lifecycle of a service instance. For example, Cloud Storage is a service that provides object storage, suitable for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured data. Cloud SQL, on the other hand, is a fully managed relational database service that provides a persistent storage solution for structured data. Finally, Persistent Disks provide block storage for GCP virtual machines, offering high performance and durability. These storage services can be configured for varying degrees of durability and availability depending on the needs of the application. They all rely on redundant storage across multiple physical locations to ensure data durability and high availability.
