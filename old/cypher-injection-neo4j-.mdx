# Cypher Injection (neo4j)


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Cypher Injection is a form of attack in which an attacker inserts malicious Cypher code into a query that is then executed by the Neo4j graph database. Cypher is a graph query language that is specifically designed for querying the Neo4j Database. This attack can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation or even data loss.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding Cypher Injection is important for anyone working with Neo4j databases. This attack exploits the very flexibility that makes Cypher a powerful querying tool, turning it into a potential security risk. Therefore, developers need to be aware of this threat in order to implement proper safeguards and protect sensitive data.


### ⛏️ How ?

To prevent Cypher Injection attacks, it's crucial to never build Cypher queries by concatenating strings. Instead, use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which can automatically sanitize input and prevent malicious code from being executed. Also, implement proper access control, ensuring that only authorized users can execute certain queries.


### ⏳ When ?

Cypher Injection attacks have become more prevalent with the increasing popularity of Neo4j databases. As more organizations adopt graph databases for their flexibility and power, the need for awareness and protection against such attacks has become even more critical.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At the heart of a Cypher Injection attack is the exploitation of the Cypher query language's flexibility. Typically, an attacker will inject malicious Cypher code into a query, with the aim of manipulating the query to perform actions it was not originally intended to do. For example, an attacker might insert code that alters the WHERE clause of a query, allowing them to access data they're not meant to see. To counter this, developers should avoid string concatenation when building queries, as this is what allows the injection to occur. Instead, using parameterized queries or prepared statements can ensure that user input is properly sanitized before the query is executed. Furthermore, implementing robust access controls can prevent unauthorized queries from being executed, providing an additional layer of protection.
