# Sniff Leak


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Sniff Leak is a term used to describe a method of data exfiltration where sensitive information is detected and captured as it is transmitted over a network. It often involves using tools to 'sniff' or monitor network traffic, looking for data that should not be there.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding Sniff Leak is important because it is a common method used by attackers to steal sensitive information. By monitoring network traffic, attackers can capture data such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or confidential documents. This knowledge can help in identifying potential security holes and implementing measures to prevent such attacks.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To protect against Sniff Leak, one can implement measures such as network segmentation, encrypted communications, and intrusion detection systems. Regularly monitoring network traffic and controlling who has access to what information can also help in detecting and preventing such attacks.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The practice of Sniff Leak has been around as long as networks have been transmitting sensitive data. However, it has become more prevalent with the increase in cyber-attacks and the availability of tools that make it easier to monitor network traffic.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

At the most basic level, Sniff Leak involves using tools to monitor network traffic. These tools, known as packet sniffers, analyze the packets of data being transmitted over a network. They can detect sensitive information in these packets, such as login credentials or credit card numbers. Once an attacker has this information, they can use it to gain unauthorized access to systems or engage in fraudulent activities. To protect against Sniff Leak, one can implement measures such as network segmentation, encrypted communications, and intrusion detection systems. Regularly monitoring network traffic and controlling who has access to what information can also help in detecting and preventing such attacks.
