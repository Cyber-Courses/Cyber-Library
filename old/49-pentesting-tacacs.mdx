# 49 - Pentesting TACACS+


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus) is a protocol used for network device authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA). It is commonly used in large network environments, providing centralized control over network access and ensuring only authorized users can access network resources.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Pentesting TACACS+ is crucial as it helps organizations test and strengthen their network security. As TACACS+ is used to control access to critical network resources, any vulnerabilities in it can lead to unauthorized access, data loss, or even network shutdown. Understanding how to pentest TACACS+ is therefore critical for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone involved in maintaining network security.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

Pentesting TACACS+ involves several steps. First, you must identify the TACACS+ servers in your network, usually done via network scanning. Once identified, you can use a tool like Hydra to perform a brute force attack, testing for weak or default passwords. After gaining access, you can explore the server's configuration, looking for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. Remember, the goal is to identify and fix vulnerabilities, not to cause harm.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The use of TACACS+ for network AAA started in the 1990s, but it's only in the recent years that pentesting TACACS+ became more common due to increasing cyber threats.

TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus) is a crucial protocol used in large-scale network environments. Operating over TCP port 49, it provides individualized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. This separate and independent provision of AAA services offers a flexible and robust framework for network access control.

An essential feature of TACACS+ is that it encrypts the entire packet payload, including the header. This encryption significantly enhances the security of data transmission between the client and the server, ensuring that sensitive information, like user credentials and commands, cannot be intercepted and read during transmission.

However, despite these robust security measures, TACACS+ is not immune to potential security threats. Incorrect configurations or lack of adequate protection measures can leave it vulnerable to attacks. A commonly observed vulnerability is the use of weak or default passwords. Cyber attackers can use brute force attacks, where they try numerous password combinations, to crack these weak passwords and gain unauthorized access.

Similarly, configuration errors like granting excessive permissions to users or neglecting to update to the latest software version can also create security loopholes. For instance, excessive permissions could allow a user to access sensitive areas of the network that they should not have access to, while outdated software versions could have unpatched vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.

Therefore, it is crucial to perform regular penetration testing (pentesting) on TACACS+. Pentesting helps identify these vulnerabilities, allowing network administrators to fix them and strengthen network security, thereby ensuring that only authorized users can access network resources.

Let's walk through a simplified example of pentesting a TACACS+ server. This is for educational purposes only.

1. **Identify TACACS+ servers**: The first step is to identify the TACACS+ servers in your network. We can use a network scanning tool like nmap for this. The command might look like this:

```
nmap -p 49 <IP range

```

This command tells nmap to scan the specified IP range for TCP port 49, which TACACS+ uses.

1. **Perform a brute force attack**: After identifying a TACACS+ server, we can use a tool like Hydra to perform a brute force attack, which involves testing multiple combinations of usernames and passwords. An example command might look like this:

```
hydra -P passwordlist.txt -s 49 <target IPtacacs+

```

This command tells Hydra to use the passwords in `passwordlist.txt` to attempt to authenticate to the TACACS+ server at the target IP address.

1. **Explore server configuration**: If you gain access, you can explore the server's configuration, looking for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. For instance, you might look for users with more permissions than necessary or outdated software versions.
2. **Report and fix vulnerabilities**: Any vulnerabilities you find should be reported and fixed promptly. For example, if you find that a user has unnecessary permissions, you should reduce their permissions to the appropriate level.

Remember, this example is highly simplified and real-world pentesting involves many more steps and much more sophistication. Always ensure to perform these actions in a legal and ethical manner, and only on systems for which you have explicit permission.
