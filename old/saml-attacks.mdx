# SAML Attacks


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) attacks occur when an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in SAML to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to a system. SAML is an open standard that allows identity providers (IdP) to pass authorization credentials to service providers (SP).


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding SAML attacks is crucial for cybersecurity professionals as they are a common technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to networks and sensitive data. Businesses and organizations that use SAML for single sign-on (SSO) functionalities are at risk of these attacks, which can lead to data breaches.


### ⛏️ How ?

To protect against SAML attacks, organizations should implement strict input validation, use strong and unique credentials, regularly update and patch systems, and employ security monitoring tools to detect unusual activity. Training employees to recognize and avoid potential phishing attempts can also reduce the risk of SAML attacks.


### ⏳ When ?

SAML attacks have become increasingly common as more organizations adopt SAML for SSO functionalities. The first major SAML attack was reported in 2018, when cybercriminals exploited a SAML vulnerability to breach the US government's HealthCare.gov portal.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

In a SAML attack, an attacker manipulates the SAML Response or Assertion to trick the service provider (SP) into believing that the user has been authenticated, when in reality, they have not. This is often done by modifying the NameID, which is the element in the SAML Assertion that identifies the user. By changing the NameID, an attacker can impersonate any user, including administrators, and gain full access to the system. Other methods include XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks, where an attacker wraps a SAML Response within another, and the SP processes the inner Response, which contains the attacker's credentials.
