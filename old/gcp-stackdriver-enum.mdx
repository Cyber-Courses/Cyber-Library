# GCP - Stackdriver Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP's Stackdriver is a versatile monitoring, logging, and diagnostics tool designed to cater to the needs of applications running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to maintain visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of their cloud-powered applications.


### 🧐 Why ?

In the ever-evolving digital age, ensuring optimum performance and minimizing downtime of cloud-based applications is crucial. Stackdriver helps in achieving this by providing insights into how the application is performing and how users are interacting with it. It also allows for proactive identification and fixing of performance issues before they affect users. Its capabilities such as event logging, error reporting, tracing, and debugging make it an essential tool for developers and administrators managing applications on GCP and AWS.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use Stackdriver, you start by creating a Stackdriver account and linking it with your GCP or AWS account. This allows Stackdriver to access data from your cloud resources. You can then set up custom dashboards for specific sets of metrics or use the pre-configured dashboards provided by Stackdriver. Stackdriver also provides APIs that allow you to send custom metrics and events from your application, and you can set up alerts based on these metrics or events.


### ⏳ When ?

Introduced in 2014, Stackdriver has been a part of Google Cloud Platform since 2016. It is typically used from the start of application deployment on GCP or AWS, and throughout the application's lifecycle.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Stackdriver works by collecting metrics, events, and metadata from GCP, AWS, and other application resources. It then processes and ingests this data into a time-series database for real-time analysis. Users can visualize this data on custom dashboards, filter and search it based on various parameters, and set up alerts based on specific conditions. Stackdriver's logging capability allows for centralized logging of system and application logs, and its Trace feature provides latency sampling and reporting. On the other hand, its Debug feature allows users to inspect the state of an application at any code location without stopping or slowing down the system.
