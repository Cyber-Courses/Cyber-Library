# 403 & 401 Bypasses


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

403 and 401 bypasses are techniques used by cybersecurity professionals and hackers to gain unauthorized access to web resources. These bypasses exploit the way a web server handles HTTP status codes 403 (Forbidden) and 401 (Unauthorized).


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding 403 and 401 bypasses is crucial in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity. On the offensive side, these bypasses can be used to gain access to sensitive information or perform actions without proper authorization. On the defensive side, understanding these bypasses can help developers and system administrators strengthen their security measures and prevent unauthorized access.


### ⛏️ How ?

403 and 401 bypasses can be performed using various methods. Often, these involve manipulating the HTTP request (e.g., changing the HTTP method from GET to POST, or modifying the path or query parameters) to trick the server into granting access.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of 403 and 401 bypasses has been prevalent since the early days of the web, and they continue to be a significant concern in today's cybersecurity landscape.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

HTTP status codes 403 (Forbidden) and 401 (Unauthorized) are used by web servers to indicate that a client is not authorized to access a requested resource. A 403 error is returned when the client is completely forbidden from accessing the resource, regardless of authentication. A 401 error, on the other hand, is returned when the client needs to authenticate itself to get the requested response.

These codes can be exploited by malicious actors in what are known as 403 and 401 bypasses. The exploitation involves manipulating the HTTP request to trick the server into granting access to the restricted resource. This manipulation can take various forms, such as changing the HTTP method (for instance, from GET to POST), modifying the path or query parameters, or even using various encoding techniques to obfuscate the request.

The goal of these bypasses is to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to perform actions without proper authorization. For example, a hacker may be able to view sensitive user data, modify content, or even execute commands on the server.

It's crucial for cybersecurity professionals to understand these bypasses. In offensive cybersecurity, professionals can use this knowledge to identify vulnerabilities in a system and recommend improvements. In defensive cybersecurity, understanding these bypasses can help professionals design and implement stronger security measures to prevent such unauthorized access.

These bypass techniques have been prevalent since the early days of the web and continue to pose significant challenges in today's cybersecurity landscape. As such, ongoing research, regular system updates, and continuous learning are essential to keep up with evolving threats and to ensure the security of web resources.

Let's consider a hypothetical scenario to illustrate a 403 and 401 bypass. Imagine a website with a URL '[example.com/admin](http://example.com/admin)' that's intended only for administrators. If a non-admin user tries to access this URL, they might receive a 403 or 401 error.

Step 1: Initial Attempt

```bash
curl -X GET '<http://example.com/admin'

```

This command sends a GET request to the server. If the user is not allowed access, the server might return a 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized error.

Step 2: Bypass Attempt

```bash
curl -X POST '<http://example.com/admin'

```

The user then changes the HTTP method from GET to POST. Some servers might not properly check permissions for different methods, allowing the bypass.

Step 3: Further Manipulation

```bash
curl -X POST '<http://example.com/admin/../'

```

Here, the user adds '../' to the end of the URL, attempting to trick the server into granting access. Some servers may not properly sanitize the input, leading to a directory traversal issue.

Each step of this process involves manipulating the HTTP request to trick the server into granting access. This example is simplified and in real-world scenarios attackers might employ more complex techniques and obfuscation. The goal is not to encourage unauthorized access, but to illustrate the types of vulnerabilities that might exist so they can be addressed and secured.
