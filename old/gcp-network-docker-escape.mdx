# GCP - Network Docker Escape


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Network Docker Escape is a technique used by attackers to break out of a Docker container and gain unauthorized access to the GCP network.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP Network Docker Escape is crucial for security professionals because Docker containers are frequently used to isolate applications in GCP environments. If an attacker can escape from a container, they can potentially compromise the entire network.


### ⛏️ How ?

To prevent GCP Network Docker Escape, it's important to follow best practices for Docker security. This includes regularly updating Docker to the latest version, limiting the capabilities of containers, and using secure container images.


### ⏳ When ?

Docker escapes have been a known issue since Docker's inception, but they became particularly relevant for GCP users as the platform's popularity grew and more businesses started using Docker containers in their GCP environments.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

A Docker escape typically involves exploiting a vulnerability in the Docker software or its configuration. For instance, an attacker might exploit a flaw in the Docker engine that allows them to execute commands with root privileges on the host system. From there, they can potentially access the GCP network and launch further attacks. One way to mitigate this risk is to limit the capabilities of Docker containers, for example by disabling certain Linux capabilities that are not needed by the containerized application. Regularly updating Docker is also essential, as this helps to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.
