# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Phone Number Injection is a cybersecurity threat where an attacker manipulates the system to inject a malicious phone number into a website or system. This could lead to various forms of exploitation such as phishing attacks, data exfiltration, or even identity theft.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding and preventing Phone Number Injection is crucial as it poses a significant threat to individual and organizational security. It can be used to mislead individuals into revealing confidential information or to exploit system vulnerabilities for malicious intent. Our readers should be aware of this threat to take appropriate preventive measures and to protect their online presence.


### ⛏️ How ?

To prevent Phone Number Injection, always validate and sanitize any phone number inputs in your system. Also, use secure coding practices and regularly review and update your security measures. Encourage users to be vigilant on the information they share and click while online.


### ⏳ When ?

Phone Number Injection has been used by cyber attackers for years, but it has gained more importance with the rapid digitalization and increased use of mobile phones for online activities.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

From a technical perspective, Phone Number Injection exploits inadequate input validation measures in a system. Attackers manipulate the system to replace legitimate phone numbers with malicious ones. When users interact with these injected phone numbers, such as by calling or texting them, they get exposed to potential threats like phishing attacks. The underlying principle behind this threat is the lack of secure coding practices and user awareness. Implementing robust validation and sanitization measures, user education, and system vigilance are key to counter this threat.
