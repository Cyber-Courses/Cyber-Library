# 3299 - Pentesting SAPRouter


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Pentesting SAPRouter involves conducting penetration tests on SAPRouter, a software application that acts as a proxy between networks in an SAP system landscape. SAPRouter controls access to your SAP system by interpreting SAPRouter route strings in SAP network connections.


### 🧐 Why ?

Pentesting SAPRouter is crucial because it helps discover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious attackers. A compromised SAPRouter could potentially give an attacker access to sensitive data and even control over the system. Given SAP systems are often used for critical business processes, this could lead to significant financial and operational damage.


### ⛏️ How ?

To pentest SAPRouter, start by scanning for open SAPRouter services using tools like Nmap. Once identified, use the Saprouttab configuration file to understand the access control list. Next, use penetration testing tools like Metasploit to identify vulnerabilities. Always remember to follow ethical hacking guidelines, which include getting proper permissions before starting the test and not exploiting the vulnerabilities beyond the scope of the test.


### ⏳ When ?

Pentesting SAPRouter should be a regular practice, especially before deploying any new SAP systems or making significant changes to existing ones. It's also advisable to do it at regular intervals as part of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

SAPRouter functions as an intermediary in network connections amongst different SAP systems. It interprets SAP Route strings and operates as an application-level gateway. This means that it can either allow, deny, or route connections based on a specific set of rules defined in the saprouttab configuration file. Essentially, this file serves as an access control list (ACL) for the SAPRouter, stipulating who has access to what within the system.

Pentesting, or penetration testing, of the SAPRouter is a significant process, as it verifies the security of your SAP systems. This is achieved by checking whether the rules defined in the saprouttab are secure. If these rules are not secure, it could lead to potential vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could also arise if the SAPRouter is misconfigured, if the software is outdated, or if it's operating on an insecure network.

Misconfiguration can occur if the SAPRouter is set up incorrectly, leading to unwarranted access or exposure. Outdated software could have known vulnerabilities that have been patched in later versions but are still exploitable in the current version. An insecure network could provide an easy way for attackers to get into the system and potentially exploit the SAPRouter.

Therefore, regular penetration testing of the SAPRouter is crucial as part of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. It can expose potential vulnerabilities and provide a chance to rectify them before they can be exploited. This should be done especially before implementing any new SAP systems or making significant changes to existing ones.

For instance, let's consider the scenario of pentesting an SAPRouter service. Here is a simplified example of how the process might work:

1. **Scanning for SAPRouter services:** We start by identifying the SAP systems in the network using a network scanning tool like Nmap. An Nmap command could look something like this:

```bash
nmap -p 3299 <target-ip

```

This command scans the target IP address for open services on port 3299, the default port for SAPRouter.

1. **Reviewing Saprouttab file:** Next, we review the Saprouttab file which contains the access control list (ACL) of the SAPRouter. This file stipulates who has access to what within the system. An insecure configuration might look like this:

```bash
P * * *

```

This rule permits all (P) connections (*) from any source (*) to any target (*).

1. **Identifying vulnerabilities:** Now we proceed to identify vulnerabilities. The Metasploit Framework, a penetration testing software, offers several modules for SAP pentesting. For example:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_router_portscanner
set RHOSTS <target-ip
run

```

This command uses the SAP Router Port Scanner module to scan the target SAPRouter service for any open internal ports.

1. **Reporting vulnerabilities:** Finally, any identified vulnerabilities are reported and steps are taken to rectify them. This could involve adjusting the saprouttab rules, updating the SAPRouter software, or improving network security.

Remember, this is a simplified example and real-world penetration tests can be much more complex and require explicit permission.
