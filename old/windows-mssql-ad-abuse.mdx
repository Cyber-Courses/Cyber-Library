# Windows MSSQL AD Abuse


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Windows MSSQL AD Abuse refers to the exploitation of Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) environments in conjunction with Active Directory (AD) to compromise Windows systems. It is a complex cyberattack method that involves manipulating MSSQL and AD's functionalities, often leading to unauthorized data access, system control, and potential data breaches.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Understanding Windows MSSQL AD Abuse is critical due to its potential to cause severe damage to organizations. By exploiting vulnerabilities in MSSQL and AD, attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or take control of the system, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and damage to the organization‚Äôs reputation. Therefore, having knowledge of this attack method can help in implementing appropriate security measures and minimizing the risks associated with it.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To prevent Windows MSSQL AD Abuse, organizations should regularly update and patch their MSSQL and AD environments, enforce strong password policies, restrict database and directory access rights, and monitor the activity on their servers. Additionally, organizations can implement security tools that detect unusual behavior or anomalies in the network, which may indicate a potential attack. Training IT staff on the latest cybersecurity threats and countermeasures is also crucial.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Windows MSSQL AD Abuse has become more prevalent with the growing use of MSSQL and AD in many organizations. It has been practiced since the early 2000s when MSSQL and AD started to become widely used in enterprise environments.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Windows MSSQL AD Abuse is a sophisticated cyberattack method that targets vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) and Active Directory (AD). The attack usually follows a multi-step process. First, attackers exploit a weakness in the MSSQL server, often using weak or default credentials to gain initial access. This is only the first step, as the attacker then needs to elevate their privileges within the system. This is typically achieved by exploiting system misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the server's software.

Once the attacker has obtained a higher level of privileges, they can then manipulate AD functionalities. This can involve creating new user accounts with administrative privileges or modifying existing user privileges. This provides the attacker with unauthorized access to data or even control over the entire system.

It's important to note that this type of attack requires a deep understanding of MSSQL and AD and the ability to exploit their functionalities. The complexity lies not only in the multi-step process but also in the technical knowledge required to successfully carry out the attack.

Preventing such attacks involves several measures. Regularly updating and patching MSSQL and AD environments is critical, as is enforcing strong password policies and restricting database and directory access rights. Monitoring server activity can also help detect any unusual behavior or anomalies, which could indicate a potential attack. Furthermore, training IT staff on the latest cybersecurity threats and countermeasures is essential for maintaining a robust security posture.

A detailed example of Windows MSSQL AD Abuse might follow the following steps:

**Step 1: Initial Access**

A hacker might start by identifying a vulnerable MSSQL server. This could be done using a tool like Nmap for network scanning.

```bash
nmap -p1433 --script ms-sql-info targetIP

```

The `-p1433` option targets MSSQL's default port and `ms-sql-info` script retrieves information from the MSSQL server.

**Step 2: Exploiting Weak or Default Credentials**

Assuming they discover a server without a strong password policy, they could exploit this using a tool like `Hydra`:

```bash
hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt targetIP mssql

```

Here, `user.txt` and `pass.txt` are files containing potential usernames and passwords, respectively.

**Step 3: Privilege Escalation**

After gaining initial access, the attacker would then focus on escalating their privileges. They might use an exploit like CVE-2020-1472 (also known as "Zerologon") that allows them to impersonate any computer, including the domain controller itself.

**Step 4: Manipulating Active Directory**

Once they've escalated their privileges, the attacker would be able to manipulate AD. They might create a new user with administrative privileges using the `net user` command, as follows:

```bash
net user hacker H@ck3rP@ss /add
net localgroup Administrators hacker /add

```

The first command creates a new user named 'hacker' with a password 'H@ck3rP@ss', and the second adds the new user to the Administrators group.

These are just illustrative steps and tools, and real-world attacks may involve more sophisticated techniques and multiple stages. The key to prevention lies in robust security practices like regular patching, strong password policies, restricted access rights, active monitoring, and ongoing staff training.
