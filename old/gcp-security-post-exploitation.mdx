# GCP - Security Post Exploitation


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP 'Security Post Exploitation' refers to the methodologies, tools, and tactics that attackers use to maintain persistence and expand access within a compromised Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment after gaining initial foothold. This can involve actions such as escalating privileges, moving laterally, and exfiltrating data.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding post exploitation practices in GCP environments is critical as it helps organizations to develop effective defense strategies. It allows them to anticipate potential attack paths, implement necessary controls and mitigate threats effectively. It is also crucial in incident response, to identify how attackers may have moved within the environment.


### ⛏️ How ?

To leverage GCP Security Post Exploitation, one must first gain unauthorized access to a GCP environment. Post exploitation actions may include: abusing misconfigured IAM policies for privilege escalation, leveraging cloud services for lateral movement, and exploiting cloud storage and data transfer services for data exfiltration. These actions often involve a deep understanding of GCP architecture, APIs, and services.


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of GCP Security Post Exploitation started gaining more attention with the rise of cloud services and the increase in cloud-specific attacks. As organizations started migrating their workloads to GCP, attackers also started to develop and refine their techniques to exploit these environments.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At the center of GCP Security Post Exploitation is the understanding of GCP's architecture, services, and APIs. For instance, attackers might exploit misconfigured IAM policies to gain higher privileges. This could involve listing IAM policies to identify weak configurations, and then using the 'gcloud' tool to escalate privileges. Another common tactic is to use GCP's services for lateral movement. An attacker could, for example, leverage GCP's Pub/Sub service to send data from one point in the environment to another. Lastly, attackers might exploit GCP's cloud storage and data transfer services for data exfiltration. For example, they could use the 'gsutil' tool to transfer data from a GCP bucket to another location. All these actions underscore the importance of securing GCP environments, including proper configuration of IAM policies and monitoring of cloud services.
