# 2FA/OTP Bypass


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

2FA/OTP Bypass is a technique used by attackers to get around two-factor authentication (2FA) or one-time password (OTP) security measures. It involves tricking a system into thinking that the attacker has provided the correct second factor (like a biometric or a token) when they have not.


### 🧐 Why ?

2FA/OTP Bypass is important because it represents a significant threat to cybersecurity. Even though 2FA and OTP are widely used and generally considered secure, they are not foolproof. Understanding how 2FA/OTP Bypass works can help us build more secure systems and identify potential areas of vulnerability.


### ⛏️ How ?

There are several methods for bypassing 2FA/OTP. Some involve social engineering, where the attacker tricks the victim into providing their second factor. Others involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the system itself. For example, if a system doesn't properly check the second factor, an attacker might be able to bypass it altogether.


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of 2FA/OTP Bypass has been around for as long as 2FA and OTP themselves. However, as these security measures have become more widespread, so too have the efforts to bypass them.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, 2FA/OTP Bypass can involve a range of techniques. For instance, in a 'man in the middle' attack, an attacker might intercept the OTP as it's being sent from the server to the client. Another method is 'session hijacking', where the attacker takes over the user's session after they've logged in. Each of these methods involves different technical skills and knowledge, and each presents its own challenges for defenders.
