# 9042/9160 - Pentesting Cassandra


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Pentesting Cassandra, or penetration testing on Apache Cassandra databases, is a method of evaluating the security of a Cassandra database by simulating attacks from malicious sources. The test targets the ports 9042 and 9160, commonly used by Cassandra for client connections and Thrift clients respectively.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Pentesting Cassandra is crucial because it helps to identify any potential security loopholes that could be exploited by cybercriminals. Cassandra is a highly scalable and distributed database, which makes it a lucrative target for attackers. The ports 9042 and 9160 are particularly sensitive since they are typically open for client connections and any vulnerability could lead to data leakage or unauthorized data manipulation.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To perform a pentest on a Cassandra database, one can use various tools like Nmap for port scanning, Cassandra-stress tool for load testing, and cqlsh, a Python-based command-line client, for interacting with Cassandra. These tools can help identify open ports, test the database's ability to handle large amounts of data, and execute queries to test the database's response, respectively. It is crucial to follow a systematic approach - starting from reconnaissance, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment to finally exploitation and reporting.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Pentesting should be carried out regularly, especially when there are changes in the database configuration or updates in the Cassandra version. However, it is recommended to perform these tests in a test environment to avoid disruptions in the production environment.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Cassandra's distributed architecture leads to high resilience due to the absence of a single point of failure. Consequently, if an attacker breaches one node, they might potentially access the entire database. In penetration testing, emphasis should be placed on detecting weak authentication mechanisms, insecure data transportation, and system misconfigurations.

Weak authentication mechanisms are security vulnerabilities that might allow unauthorized access. For example, using 'cassandra' as the default user with the default password presents a substantial security risk. Periodically changing passwords and enforcing strong password policies can help mitigate such risks.

Insecure data transportation refers to the transfer of data across the network in an unprotected format. If data is sent in plaintext over the network, sensitive information can be exposed to potential attackers. To prevent this, data encryption during transportation and storage can be implemented.

Misconfigurations are another area of concern. They occur when security settings are incorrectly set up or neglected. For instance, enabling the Thrift interface without effective access controls can lead to unauthorized data access. Regular audits and reviews of system configurations can help identify and rectify such oversights.

Thus, to ensure the security of a Cassandra database, it is crucial to conduct regular penetration testing, especially after changes in the database configuration or updates in the Cassandra version. It is also essential to use a systematic approach during testing, that includes reconnaissance, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting.

Let's consider a hypothetical example of pentesting a Cassandra database:

1. **Reconnaissance**: First, we need to identify the target. In this case, let's assume the target is a Cassandra node with the IP address 192.168.1.1. We can use `nmap` to scan for open ports. The command would look something like this:
    
    ```
    nmap -p 9042,9160 192.168.1.1
    
    ```
    
    This command will scan the ports 9042 and 9160 on the target IP address.
    
2. **Threat Modeling**: After we've identified the target, we need to understand the potential threats. For Cassandra, we might be concerned about weak authentication, insecure data transportation, and system misconfigurations.
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Next, we need to assess the target for vulnerabilities. For example, we can try to connect to the database using default credentials. If the default credentials work, this is a significant security issue. The command could look like this:
    
    ```
    cqlsh 192.168.1.1 9042 -u cassandra -p cassandra
    
    ```
    
    If this command connects successfully, then the database is using the default 'cassandra' username and password, which is a security risk.
    
4. **Exploitation**: If we find a vulnerability, we can then try to exploit it. Given that we have access to the Cassandra database, we can execute any CQL command. As an example, let's list all keyspaces:
    
    ```
    DESCRIBE KEYSPACES;
    
    ```
    
    This command will list all keyspaces in the database, providing potentially sensitive information.
    
5. **Reporting**: Finally, we would document all findings, methods used, and provide recommendations for improving security. This might include suggesting password policy changes, implementing data encryption, or rectifying system misconfigurations.

Remember, this is just an example for educational purposes. Always ensure you have the appropriate permissions before carrying out any penetration testing activities.
