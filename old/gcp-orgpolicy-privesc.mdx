# GCP - Orgpolicy Privesc


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> GCP Orgpolicy Privilege Escalation is a security concern that occurs in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It involves exploiting permissions in an organization's policy to gain unauthorized access or privileges.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> This security concern is significant because it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, system manipulations, and potential breaches. It is crucial for organizations using GCP to understand and address this risk to secure their cloud resources effectively.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To prevent GCP Orgpolicy Privilege Escalation, organizations should employ the principle of least privilege, regularly review and update security policies, and use tools to detect any policy misconfigurations. It's also essential to educate team members about the risk and how to identify potential threats.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The risk of GCP Orgpolicy Privilege Escalation emerged as organizations started to adopt cloud services like GCP and grant permissions to different users, leading to potential misconfigurations or misuse.
> 

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

GCP Orgpolicy Privilege Escalation revolves around the misconfiguration or misuse of GCP's organization policy. This policy determines what actions users or service accounts can perform, what resources they can access, and what locations they can use. If a user or service account is granted too many permissions, they could potentially exploit these to access sensitive data or manipulate systems within the organization's GCP environment. Preventing this involves proper configuration of organization policies, routine security audits, and the use of security tools to detect potential threats.
