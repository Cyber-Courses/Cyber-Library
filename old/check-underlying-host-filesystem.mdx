# Check Underlying Host Filesystem


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

The Check Underlying Host Filesystem is a process that involves examining the root file system of a host machine to ensure its integrity and security. This method involves scrutinizing the host's filesystem to detect any discrepancies that might signal a compromise, such as unauthorized access, alteration of system files, or the presence of malicious software.


### üßê¬†Why ?

The Check Underlying Host Filesystem process is crucial for maintaining system security. It allows administrators to quickly detect and react to potential security breaches, ensuring that system files and data remain secure. In a world where cybersecurity threats are ever-evolving and increasingly sophisticated, this process is an essential aspect of a robust defense strategy.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To conduct a Check Underlying Host Filesystem process, start by accessing the host's root file system. You may need to use specific software or tools depending on the operating system. Once you've gained access, you can begin inspecting the system files. Look for any changes that you did not authorize, including modifications to file permissions, unexpected file growth, or the creation of new, unknown files. If you detect any abnormalities, investigate further to determine whether they pose a security threat.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The practice of checking the underlying host filesystem has been in use from the earliest days of networked computing, as it provides a basic level of assurance about the integrity of the system. However, as cyber threats have evolved and become more complex, the importance of this practice has grown and it has become a staple in any comprehensive cybersecurity strategy.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

The Check Underlying Host Filesystem procedure is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, ensuring the integrity and security of a host machine. It involves a thorough examination of the root file system, which is the primary file system on which the operating system and other system files are stored.

The process starts with accessing the root file system. Depending on the operating system of the host machine, specific software or tools may be needed for this. Once access is acquired, the process of inspecting the system files begins. The goal is to identify any unauthorized changes, including alterations to file permissions, unexpected file growth, or the creation of new files that are unknown or unaccounted for. Any discrepancies found could indicate potential security breaches, such as unauthorized access or the presence of malicious software.

To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of this process, a combination of manual inspection and automated scanning tools are used. Automated tools can scan through vast amounts of data quickly, identifying potential indicators of compromise. These could include unexpected changes to system files, such as file permissions or timestamps, unexpected file growth, or the creation of new, unknown files. These indicators help in pinpointing potential security breaches.

Upon detection of any abnormalities, further investigation is carried out to determine the nature and extent of the breach. This could involve checking system logs, performing malware scans, or conducting a forensic analysis of the impacted files.

Regularly performing a Check Underlying Host Filesystem is crucial in maintaining system security. It allows for early detection of potential security breaches, enabling administrators to take swift action to mitigate any damage. This proactive approach helps to ensure that system files and data remain secure, enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of the organization.

For instance, in a Unix-based system like Linux, you might use the `find` command to search for files that have been modified in the last 24 hours:

```bash
find / -mtime 0

```

Here, `/` specifies that the search should start from the root directory and `mtime 0` instructs `find` to look for files modified within the last day.

After identifying recently modified files, you could use the `ls -l` command to check their permissions:

```bash
ls -l /path/to/file

```

This command will display the file permissions on the left side of the output. For example, `-rw-r--r--` indicates that the owner has read and write permissions, and the group and others have read permissions.

If you find a file that should not have been modified or has suspicious permissions, you might want to investigate further using a tool like `aide` (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment), which can detect changes to files and directories. Here's an example of how to set up and run `aide`:

```bash
# Initialize the database
aide --init
# Move the database to the correct location
mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz
# Run aide
aide --check

```

This will compare the current state of the system with the state recorded in the database and report any discrepancies.

Remember, these are just examples. The actual processes and tools you would use depend on your specific environment and security requirements.
