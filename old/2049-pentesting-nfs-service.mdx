# 2049 - Pentesting NFS Service


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Pentesting NFS (Network File System) service refers to the process of testing the security of a network's NFS service, which enables users to access files on a network in the same way they access local storage. The fundamentals of this subject lie in understanding the working principles of NFS, the vulnerabilities it may present, and the techniques used to exploit these vulnerabilities.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Pentesting NFS is crucial as this service, if left unchecked, can present major security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can allow unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive data, manipulate data, or even gain full control of the network. Therefore, understanding and implementing this subject is important for both network administrators and cybersecurity professionals to ensure network security.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To implement NFS pentesting, start by enumerating the NFS shares using tools such as 'showmount'. Next, try to mount these shares on your local system. If successful, this could indicate a misconfiguration that allows unauthorized access. Depending on the permissions granted, you might be able to read, write, or execute files. Also, look for sensitive information that might be stored in these shares. For a more advanced approach, you can also use scripts or automated tools to scan for known NFS vulnerabilities.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Pentesting NFS services became a common practice as soon as the vulnerabilities associated with NFS services became known. This has been a critical part of network security testing since the late 1980s, following the widespread adoption of networked computing environments.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that allows users to access and interact with files over a network as if they were stored on their own computer. This is achieved by establishing a connection between a client and server, facilitating the sharing of files. However, the NFS protocol does not inherently provide robust authentication or encryption, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited in several ways. For instance, an attacker might 'mount' an NFS share on their local system, which would grant them access to all files within that share. This could lead to a security breach, with unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Another potential issue arises when an NFS server trusts a client to control file permissions. In such a scenario, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges, gaining access to even more sensitive data or systems.

Given these potential vulnerabilities, it's crucial to properly configure NFS services. This includes setting appropriate file and folder permissions, limiting access to trusted clients, and implementing additional security measures such as firewall rules and secure NFS variants that support encryption.

Regular testing for vulnerabilities, known as penetration testing or 'pentesting', is also a critical part of maintaining security in an NFS setup. This involves using a variety of tools and techniques to simulate potential attacks, identify vulnerabilities, and evaluate the effectiveness of security measures. It's important to conduct penetration testing on a regular basis and after any significant changes to the network or NFS configuration.

When vulnerabilities are detected, they should be addressed as quickly as possible. This may involve applying patches or updates, re-configuring services, or implementing additional security controls. In some cases, it may be necessary to temporarily disable the NFS service until the issue can be resolved.

In conclusion, while NFS can provide a convenient way to share files across a network, it also presents potential security risks. Therefore, it's important to understand these risks, implement appropriate security measures, and conduct regular testing to ensure the ongoing security of your network.

Let's consider an example of penetration testing an NFS service. In this hypothetical scenario, we will use a Linux system. Please note that this is for educational purposes only.

1. **Enumerate NFS Shares:** We begin by identifying the NFS shares on the network. The `showmount` command is used for this purpose.

Command: `showmount -e [target IP]`

This command lists all the NFS shares available on the target system.

1. **Mount the NFS Share:** After identifying the NFS shares, we attempt to mount a share on our local system. This can be done using the `mount` command.

Command: `mount -t nfs [target IP]:/[path to NFS share] /mnt/nfs`

This command attempts to mount the NFS share at the specified path on the target system to the `/mnt/nfs` directory on our local system. If successful, this could indicate a misconfiguration that allows unauthorized access.

1. **Access the Files:** Once the NFS share is mounted, we can navigate to the `/mnt/nfs` directory on our local system and attempt to list, read, or modify the files within the share.

Command: `cd /mnt/nfs`

Command: `ls`

Command: `cat [filename]`

These commands navigate to the mounted directory, list the files within the share, and display the contents of a specified file, respectively.

1. **Test for Vulnerabilities:** Next, we can use tools like `nmap` to scan for known NFS vulnerabilities.

Command: `nmap -p 2049 --script=nfs-showmount,nfs-statfs,nfs-ls [target IP]`

This command runs several NFS-related scripts against the target, testing for various vulnerabilities.

Remember, each of these steps could reveal potential security issues that should be addressed promptly. It's crucial to conduct these types of tests regularly and after any significant changes to your network or NFS configuration.
