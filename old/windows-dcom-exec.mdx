# Windows DCOM Exec


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

> Windows DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) Exec is a service that allows remote execution of COM objects on a Windows machine. This service is crucial for several applications and services on the Windows operating system.
> 

### 🧐 Why ?

> Understanding Windows DCOM Exec is important because it is a common target for attackers seeking to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code on a Windows server or workstation. It is also a vital component for many applications, and misconfigurations can lead to application errors or system instability.
> 

### ⛏️ How ?

> To use DCOM, developers need to implement it in their applications using the Windows SDK. Administrators can manage DCOM permissions and settings using the Component Services administrative tool in Windows. To secure DCOM, it is recommended to restrict DCOM access to trusted users, disable unnecessary DCOM applications, and regularly patch the system.
> 

### ⏳ When ?

> DCOM has been in use since it was introduced in Windows NT 4.0 in 1996. However, it has become more prominent with the rise of distributed applications.

# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

DCOM, standing for Distributed Component Object Model, is a Microsoft technology that allows client program objects to request services from server program objects on other computers in a network. This system extends the Component Object Model (COM), which is a binary-interface standard for software components to communicate within the same computer, supporting 'local InterProcess Communication'.

DCOM enables communication between client and server objects across different computers in a network, effectively supporting 'remote InterProcess Communication'. It achieves this by using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol, which transparently sends and receives information between objects, eliminating the need for the client to understand the details of the network.

DCOM was introduced in Windows NT 4.0 in 1996, and its significance has grown with the increase of distributed applications. Developers can implement DCOM into their applications using the Windows SDK, while administrators manage DCOM permissions and settings via the Component Services administrative tool in Windows.

Understanding DCOM is important due to its widespread use and its potential security implications. It is often targeted by attackers aiming to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code on a Windows server or workstation. Therefore, securing DCOM is crucial. Recommended practices include restricting DCOM access to trusted users, disabling unnecessary DCOM applications, and regularly patching the system to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.

Let's consider a scenario where an application is using DCOM to request services from a server. In this example, we have a client application on one machine that wants to utilize a service provided by a server application on another machine in the same network.

**Step 1: Implementing DCOM in the Application**

First, the developer would use the Windows SDK to implement DCOM in their client and server applications. This can be done using various programming languages like C++, C#, or [VB.NET](http://vb.net/). Here's a simplified example in C++:

```cpp
// Create a DCOM object
CoInitialize(NULL);
IDispatch *pDisp;
CoCreateInstance(CLSID_MyDCOMObject, NULL, CLSCTX_REMOTE_SERVER, IID_IDispatch, (void**)&pDisp);

```

**Step 2: Managing DCOM Permissions and Settings**

Next, the administrator would manage DCOM permissions and settings using the Component Services administrative tool in Windows. Here's how to do this:

1. Open the Component Services tool (dcomcnfg.exe).
2. Navigate to the 'Component Services' > 'Computers' > 'My Computer' > 'DCOM Config'.
3. Right-click on the relevant DCOM application (as per the CLSID specified in the code) and select 'Properties'.
4. In the 'Security' tab, adjust the permissions as needed.

**Step 3: Regular Patching and Security**

Lastly, to secure DCOM, the administrator would need to regularly patch the system and restrict DCOM access:

1. Restrict DCOM access to trusted users: This can be done in the same 'Security' tab in the DCOM application's properties in the Component Services tool.
2. Disable unnecessary DCOM applications: This can be done by setting the 'Enable Distributed COM on this computer' setting to 'False' in the 'My Computer' properties in the Component Services tool.
3. Regularly patch the system: This involves keeping the Windows OS and all applications up-to-date with the latest security patches.

This example provides a simplified overview of how DCOM could be implemented and managed in a real-world scenario. However, actual implementation will likely involve more complex code and additional security measures.
