# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

At its core, Azure Active Directory is an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution, which means it provides identity and access management functionality over the cloud. It stores details about users, groups, and devices, and it uses protocols like SAML, WS-Federation, and OAuth to authenticate and authorize access to applications and services. It also includes features for password management, self-service for application access, device registration, user provisioning, and more. AAD can be integrated with existing Windows Server Active Directory, enabling organizations to leverage their existing on-premises identity investments to manage access to cloud services.
