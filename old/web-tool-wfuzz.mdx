WFuzz operates by sending HTTP requests with various payloads to a web application. These payloads can include different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and special characters. WFuzz then analyzes the responses from the web application to identify potential vulnerabilities. The tool comes with a variety of filters and plugins to help users customize their testing. For instance, users can filter out certain HTTP response codes or use a plugin to test for specific vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection. WFuzz is also highly flexible, allowing users to fuzz any part of the HTTP request, including the method, headers, and parameters.
