# LFI2RCE via Segmentation Fault


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution (LFI2RCE) via Segmentation Fault is a cyber attack technique where an attacker exploits a local file inclusion vulnerability to trigger a segmentation fault and execute arbitrary code.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding LFI2RCE via Segmentation Fault is crucial because it's a potent attack vector that can lead to complete system compromise. Cybersecurity professionals must comprehend this technique to protect systems effectively.


### ⛏️ How ?

The attacker first identifies a local file inclusion vulnerability, which allows them to include and execute local files. They trigger a segmentation fault, causing the system to dump core. The core dump file contains the system's memory snapshot at the time of the fault, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of this attack technique has been documented in various cyber attacks over the years. However, its popularity surged as more web applications started using languages like PHP, which are susceptible to local file inclusion vulnerabilities.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

The LFI2RCE via Segmentation Fault attack starts by exploiting a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, which typically exists in web applications that include files without correctly sanitizing user input. The attacker triggers a segmentation fault, a specific kind of error caused by accessing a memory location that's 'off limits'. This causes the system to create a core dump file, which is essentially a snapshot of the system's memory at the time of the fault. The attacker can cleverly manipulate this file and the LFI vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. This technique is sophisticated and relies on deep knowledge of system memory management and the specific workings of the targeted system.
