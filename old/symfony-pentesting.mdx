# Symfony pentesting


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

> Symfony pentesting refers to the practice of testing Symfony-based applications for potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers. Symfony is a PHP web application framework and a set of reusable PHP components. Pentesting, or penetration testing, is a type of security testing designed to discover, exploit, and document potential security vulnerabilities.
> 

### 🧐 Why ?

> Understanding Symfony pentesting is crucial for developers, testers, and cybersecurity professionals. It helps in identifying vulnerabilities in Symfony-based applications before malicious hackers do. This knowledge can help in building more secure applications, thus protecting user data and company resources. It is also a valuable skill for cybersecurity professionals, as it is a part of the larger field of penetration testing.

### ⛏️ How ?

> To carry out Symfony pentesting, one needs to first set up a testing environment, usually separate from the production environment. Using tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP, pentesters can send different types of requests to the application to identify potential vulnerabilities. The testing process often includes steps like reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, and covering tracks.

### ⏳ When ?

> The practice of pentesting has been around since the late 1960s, but it has gained more importance with the increase in cyber threats. Symfony, first released in 2005, has also been a focus of pentesting as it gained popularity. As for when to conduct a pentest, it is often done during the development phase of an application, and regularly afterwards to ensure ongoing security.

# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

Symfony pentesting is a specialized form of security testing that focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in applications built with Symfony, a popular PHP web application framework. Understanding the structure and conventions of the Symfony framework is instrumental in this process.

Common vulnerabilities that pentesters often look for include SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). SQL injection involves injecting malicious SQL code into queries, potentially allowing unauthorized access to or manipulation of the database. XSS vulnerabilities enable attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, potentially resulting in data theft or manipulation. CSRF tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request, which could lead to unwanted changes in data.

Pentesters use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to send different types of requests to the application. These tools are capable of automating the process of sending requests and analyzing the responses to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Understanding PHP, the language Symfony is built on, is also important as it enables a deeper understanding of the application's code, making it easier to identify potential security issues.

Once potential vulnerabilities are identified, they need to be documented. This involves detailing the vulnerability, its potential impact, and sometimes, suggested mitigation strategies. These findings are then reported to relevant parties, usually the developer or security team of the application, so that they can be addressed.

In some cases, pentesters may also be involved in helping to fix the issues identified, although this is not always the case, as the role of a pentester is primarily to identify vulnerabilities, not to fix them.

Symfony pentesting is a dynamic and highly specialized field, requiring a deep understanding of web application security principles, the Symfony framework, and PHP.

Let's consider a simplified example of a SQL injection vulnerability in a Symfony application.

Suppose we have a UserController with a function that retrieves a user's details from a MySQL database:

```php
public function getUserAction($username) {
    $conn = $this->get('database_connection');
    $user = $conn->query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ' . $username);
    return $this->render('user.html.twig', array('user' => $user));
}

```

This code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly includes the `$username` in the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.

For example, an attacker could input a `$username` such as `admin'; --`, resulting in the following SQL query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'; --'

```

The `--` is a comment symbol in SQL, so everything after it would be ignored. As a result, the attacker would retrieve the data of the 'admin' user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.

A better approach would be using prepared statements to sanitize the input and prevent SQL injection:

```php
public function getUserAction($username) {
    $conn = $this->get('database_connection');
    $stmt = $conn->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username');
    $stmt->execute(array('username' => $username));
    $user = $stmt->fetch();
    return $this->render('user.html.twig', array('user' => $user));
}

```

In this modified code, `:username` is a placeholder that gets replaced with the sanitized `$username` value when the query is executed. This prevents the attacker from injecting SQL code via the `$username` variable.

The pentester would identify the initial vulnerability by sending a request with a `' OR '1'='1` payload, which would often result in revealing all users' details if the application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Using tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP, they would automate the sending of such payloads and analyze the responses for signs of vulnerability.

Once the vulnerability is identified, the pentester would document it, stating its potential impact (unauthorized data access) and suggested mitigation strategies (use of prepared statements), and report these findings to the team responsible for the application's security.
