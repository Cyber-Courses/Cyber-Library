# Joomla pentesting


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Joomla pentesting refers to the process of testing Joomla-based websites for potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers. Joomla is a popular content management system (CMS) used for creating and managing websites. Like any software, Joomla has potential security issues that can be discovered and fixed before they are exploited.


### 🧐 Why ?

Joomla pentesting is important because it helps identify and fix security vulnerabilities in a Joomla website before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Joomla websites are commonly targeted by cybercriminals due to their popularity. Therefore, regular pentesting can help protect these websites from data breaches, unauthorized access, and similar security threats.


### ⛏️ How ?

Joomla pentesting can be performed using various tools and techniques. These include automated scanning tools, manual code review, and penetration tests. Automated scanning tools can quickly identify common vulnerabilities, while manual code review can discover more complex security issues. Penetration tests involve simulating attacks to identify potential vulnerabilities.


### ⏳ When ?

Joomla pentesting should be performed regularly, especially after major updates or changes to the Joomla website. It is also important to conduct pentesting when the site is initially launched. Regular pentesting ensures that any new vulnerabilities are quickly discovered and fixed.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Joomla pentesting is a comprehensive process aimed at identifying potential security vulnerabilities in Joomla-based websites. It involves several crucial steps:

1. **Reconnaissance**: This initial stage involves gathering as much information about the Joomla site as possible. Key information includes the Joomla version, installed extensions, and configuration details. A thorough understanding of the system's structure and functionalities can assist in identifying potential weak points.
2. **Scanning**: After gathering sufficient information, the next phase is scanning. During this phase, automated tools like OWASP ZAP or Nessus are employed to identify potential vulnerabilities. These tools are designed to detect common security issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references (IDOR).
3. **Exploitation**: Once potential vulnerabilities are mapped out, the next step is exploitation, where the identified vulnerabilities are exploited to confirm their existence. This stage involves simulating attacks on the system to understand the extent of potential damage and how these vulnerabilities can be exploited in real-world scenarios.
4. **Reporting**: The final stage is reporting. This involves documenting the findings of the pentest, detailing the vulnerabilities found, their potential impacts, and recommendations on how they can be fixed. This report aids in understanding the security status of the Joomla site and provides a roadmap for necessary improvements.

Remember, Joomla pentesting should be a regular activity, especially after major updates or changes to the Joomla website. This practice ensures that any new vulnerabilities are quickly discovered and fixed, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of the website.

Let's consider an example of Joomla pentesting using OWASP ZAP, a popular open-source web application security scanner.

1. **Reconnaissance**: We start by identifying the Joomla version, installed extensions, and configuration details. This can often be found in the source code of the website and the metadata in the HTTP responses. For example, checking the HTML source code might reveal the Joomla version in a meta tag:

```html
<meta name="generator" content="Joomla! - Open Source Content Management" /

```

1. **Scanning**: After gathering sufficient information, we move to the scanning phase. We can use OWASP ZAP for this. Start ZAP, enter the Joomla website URL in the URL bar, and click 'Attack'. ZAP will start spidering the website, sending a variety of requests, and looking for vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Starting OWASP ZAP
zap.sh -cmd -quickurl <http://joomla-website.com-quickout report.xml

```

1. **Exploitation**: Once potential vulnerabilities are identified, the next step is exploitation. For instance, if a potential SQL injection vulnerability was identified during the scanning phase, we could use a tool like sqlmap to confirm the vulnerability and understand its potential impact. Suppose ZAP identified a potential SQL injection in a URL parameter like 'id'. We could use sqlmap as follows:

```bash
# Using sqlmap to exploit a potential SQL injection
sqlmap -u "<http://joomla-website.com/index.php?id=1" --dbs --batch

```

1. **Reporting**: The final stage is reporting. After conducting the pentest, we document our findings. This includes the vulnerabilities found, their potential impacts, and recommendations on how they can be fixed. For example, if we confirmed a SQL injection vulnerability, we would recommend the developers to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate this issue.

Remember, Joomla pentesting should be a regular activity to ensure the security and integrity of the website.
