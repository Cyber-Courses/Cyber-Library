# GCP - Apikeys Privesc


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP - Apikeys Privesc refers to a situation where an attacker can escalate their privileges (Privesc) in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by exploiting weakly secured API keys.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP - Apikeys Privesc is important because misconfigured API keys in GCP can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data access, data manipulation, and even complete takeover of the GCP resources. This topic is relevant to anyone using GCP for hosting their applications or data.


### ⛏️ How ?

To mitigate the risk of GCP - Apikeys Privesc, it is crucial to follow best practices for securing API keys. These include: restricting API key access to only necessary GCP resources; not embedding API keys directly in code; regenerating API keys periodically; and monitoring API key usage for any unexpected or abnormal activity.


### ⏳ When ?

The risks associated with GCP - Apikeys Privesc became more apparent as more businesses started moving their operations to the cloud. As the usage of cloud platforms like GCP increased, so did the potential for misconfigured API keys leading to security vulnerabilities.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

In GCP, API keys are used to authenticate and authorize requests to GCP APIs. An API key is associated with a GCP project and can be used to access any APIs enabled for that project. If an attacker gets hold of an API key, they can make requests to the GCP APIs on behalf of the project, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or resources. The severity of the impact depends on the permissions associated with the API key. For instance, an API key with write permissions to a database could be used to manipulate data, while an API key with administrative permissions could be used to take over the GCP resources.
