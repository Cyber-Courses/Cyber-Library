# GCP - Deploymentmaneger Privesc


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Deployment Manager Privilege Escalation (Privesc) is a security concern where an attacker with lower-level access can gain higher-level permissions. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, or even total control of the cloud environment.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP Deployment Manager Privesc is crucial as deployment managers are often targeted by attackers due to their ability to control resources, making them a prime target for privilege escalation attacks. Securing these services is paramount in preserving the integrity and confidentiality of data stored in the Google Cloud.


### ⛏️ How ?

To mitigate the risk of GCP Deployment Manager Privesc, administrators should follow the principle of least privilege by limiting user access rights to only what they need to perform their jobs. Regular security audits and monitoring should also be conducted to detect any suspicious activities. Additionally, using multi-factor authentication can further enhance the security of the cloud environment.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of GCP and by extension, the risk of GCP Deployment Manager Privesc, has grown with the rise in popularity of cloud services in the past decade. As more businesses move their operations to the cloud, the need for robust security measures has never been more important.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Deployment Manager operates based on the permissions granted to it. If an attacker gains access to an account with deployment manager rights, they can create and manage resources within the project. This includes creating instances with service account permissions, which could lead to privilege escalation if not properly managed. Therefore, it's critical to monitor for unusual activity such as the creation of new resources or changes to existing ones, as these could be signs of a potential privilege escalation attack.
