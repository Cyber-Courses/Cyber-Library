# GCP - Cloud SQL Persistence


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform's Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service that makes it easy to set up, manage, and administer relational databases on Google Cloud. It supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL and is designed to handle the demanding needs of enterprise-level, transaction-based applications.


### 🧐 Why ?

Data persistence is a crucial aspect of any application. Without a persistent storage mechanism, data would be lost whenever the application shuts down. In the context of cloud applications, this persistence becomes even more critical due to the ephemeral nature of cloud resources. Google Cloud SQL provides a solution for this, allowing developers to store and retrieve data in a reliable and efficient manner.


### ⛏️ How ?

To utilize Cloud SQL, a Google Cloud Platform account is required. Once logged in, navigate to the SQL section under the 'Storage' category. Here, you can create a new Cloud SQL instance, choosing between MySQL and PostgreSQL. Once the instance is set up, you can connect to it using standard SQL clients or Google Cloud's SDKs. Databases can be created and manipulated using standard SQL commands.


### ⏳ When ?

Cloud SQL was first launched by Google in 2012 as part of its Google Cloud Platform. Since then, it has become a popular choice for developers and businesses looking for a scalable, reliable, and fully managed relational database service.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Cloud SQL provides a high level of abstraction over traditional database management, which eliminates the need for developers to manage the underlying infrastructure. It takes care of all the mundane tasks such as patch management, failover, and backups, allowing developers to focus more on their applications rather than on database management. It is built on the same infrastructure that powers Google's own services, making it highly scalable and reliable. It supports standard connection drivers and built-in migration tools, making it easy to switch from traditional databases.
