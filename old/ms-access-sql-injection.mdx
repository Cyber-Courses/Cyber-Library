# MS Access SQL Injection


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

MS Access SQL Injection is a code injection technique that attackers use to insert malicious SQL code into a query. The primary concept underlying this technique is taking advantage of weak input validation in an application's code to manipulate SQL queries.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding MS Access SQL Injection is crucial because it is a common vulnerability in many web applications. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data corruption, and even loss of data. Therefore, anyone involved in web application development or security should be aware of this issue.


### ⛏️ How ?

To protect against MS Access SQL Injection, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which can ensure that user input is always treated as literal data and not part of SQL commands. Also, implement strong input validation and consider using web application firewalls to filter out malicious data.


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of SQL Injection started in the late 1990s, and despite the security measures put in place, it remains a significant threat due to poor coding practices.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

MS Access SQL Injection attacks occur when an application's security is compromised due to the execution of malicious SQL statements. These statements are often inserted into user input fields, exploiting the application's assumption that the input will be safe. This leads to the database interpreting the injected code as part of SQL commands, which can result in unauthorized data access, alteration, or deletion. To prevent these attacks, developers must ensure proper input validation, use parameterized queries, and regularly update and patch their systems.
