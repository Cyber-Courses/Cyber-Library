# Pentesting Network


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Pentesting Network, or network penetration testing, is a process of probing a network to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. It involves simulating attacks, identifying weak points, and understanding how data can be accessed, altered or destroyed unlawfully.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Pentesting Network is crucial because it helps organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities in their network before they can be exploited by hackers. This proactive approach reduces the risk of data breaches, protects sensitive information, and ensures the continuity of services. Furthermore, it helps in achieving compliance with various cybersecurity regulations.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

Pentesting Network typically involves several steps. Firstly, a detailed reconnaissance is carried out to gather information about the target network. This is followed by scanning the network to identify open ports and running services. After this, vulnerabilities are identified and assessed. The next step is to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to the network. Finally, a report is generated detailing the vulnerabilities found, the damage that could be caused if they were exploited, and recommendations for mitigating these risks.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The practice of pentesting networks has been increasingly adopted since the late 1990s and early 2000s, as the internet became more ubiquitous and the risks associated with network vulnerabilities became more apparent.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Pentesting, at a technical level, incorporates an array of tools and methodologies. Network scanners, such as Nmap, serve to probe the network in order to identify open ports and running services, both of which could potentially serve as points of entry for an attacker.

Vulnerability scanners, like Nessus, are employed to pinpoint known vulnerabilities within the network. These vulnerabilities could range from software bugs, weak passwords, or misconfigurations that could be exploited by malicious actors.

To exploit these vulnerabilities and thereby gain access to the network, tools like Metasploit are used. This tool provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development.

In addition to the technical methods, social engineering techniques may also be employed. This can include tactics such as phishing, where fraudulent emails are sent posing as a reputable company to induce individuals to reveal personal information, or baiting, where a user is enticed to perform an action that enables an attacker to exploit a system's vulnerabilities.

Once the pentest is completed, a comprehensive report is put together which outlines each identified vulnerability, the potential impact if exploited, and strategies recommended to mitigate these risks. This report helps organizations understand their security posture and plan for improvements.

A real-life example of network penetration testing could look as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance:** Using tools like `nmap`, we can identify the devices on a network. For example, the command `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24` will scan all the devices in the 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255 IP range.
2. **Scanning:** Once we know which devices are on the network, we can scan for open ports and services. For instance, `nmap -p- 192.168.1.1` will scan all 65535 ports on the device with IP 192.168.1.1.
3. **Vulnerability Assessment:** We can then use a tool like `Nessus` to identify known vulnerabilities. Nessus is a GUI-based tool, and the process involves inputting the target IP addresses and starting the scan.
4. **Exploitation:** A tool like `Metasploit` can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities. For instance, if we found a device with a vulnerability that has a known exploit in Metasploit, we would open Metasploit (`msfconsole`), search for the exploit (`search [exploit name]`), and use it (`use [exploit path]`). Then, set the target IP (`set RHOSTS [target IP]`) and run the exploit (`run`).
5. **Report Generation:** After the pentest, a report is written. This report would detail the vulnerabilities found, the potential impacts, and the recommended mitigation strategies. For example, if a device was found to have an open port running an outdated service with a known exploit, the report would identify this issue, explain that this could allow an attacker to gain control of the device, and recommend updating the service or closing the port.
