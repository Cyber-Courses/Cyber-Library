# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

File upload systems work by transmitting data from a client's machine to a server. This is usually done over HTTP or HTTPS protocols. When a file is uploaded, it's converted into a series of data packets which are then sent to the server. The server receives these packets and reassembles them into the original file. The file is then stored in a specified directory on the server. Security measures, such as validation, encryption, and access controls, are implemented to ensure that the file upload process is secure and that the stored files are protected from unauthorized access.
