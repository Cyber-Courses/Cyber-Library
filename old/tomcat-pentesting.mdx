# Tomcat pentesting


# üëâ¬†Overview

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Tomcat pentesting is the practice of testing the security of an Apache Tomcat server environment. Apache Tomcat is a popular open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is used to execute Java servlets and render web pages that include Java Server Page coding. Tomcat pentesting involves identifying vulnerabilities in the Tomcat server and exploiting them to understand their potential impact.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Tomcat pentesting is important because Apache Tomcat servers are widely used in enterprise environments. Many businesses rely on Tomcat servers to host their web applications. If these servers are not secured properly, they can become easy targets for hackers. By performing pentesting on Tomcat servers, businesses can identify security weaknesses and take measures to mitigate them before they can be exploited. This helps to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the business's online services.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

Tomcat pentesting involves several steps. First, the pentester needs to gather information about the target server. This can include identifying the server's IP address, the version of Tomcat being used, and any additional services running on the server. Next, the pentester tries to identify any vulnerabilities in the server. This can involve testing for common issues such as weak or default passwords, misconfigured settings, or outdated software versions. Once vulnerabilities have been identified, the pentester attempts to exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the server or to disrupt its operations. Finally, the pentester documents their findings and provides recommendations for mitigating the identified risks.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Tomcat pentesting should be performed regularly to ensure ongoing security. This could be on a yearly, quarterly, or even monthly basis depending on the critical nature of the applications hosted on the server. It should also be performed whenever a new version of Tomcat is installed, or when significant changes are made to the server's configuration or the applications it hosts.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Apache Tomcat is a widely-used open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It operates on the Java platform and follows a set of standard specifications for web servers. Specifically, it uses the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications from Sun Microsystems, providing it with a flexible and extensible architecture.

During a penetration testing (pentest), a common vulnerability to look for is weak or default credentials. If a Tomcat server is using default credentials, an attacker can gain administrative access to the Tomcat Manager App. This provides them access to upload and deploy malicious web applications, compromising the server.

Misconfigurations are another common issue. For instance, if a server allows directory listing, an attacker can view all files in a directory and download them without needing any form of authentication. This can potentially expose sensitive information or system files that could be used to further compromise the server.

Outdated versions of Tomcat can also pose as a security risk. They may be vulnerable to exploits that have been fixed in more recent versions. It's crucial to keep Tomcat updated to the latest stable version to mitigate such risks.

Once vulnerabilities are identified, pentesters use a variety of methodologies and tools to exploit them. The specific techniques used will depend on the nature of the vulnerability. Default credentials, for instance, can be exploited simply by logging in. Misconfigurations, on the other hand, might be exploited using more complicated methods such as directory traversal attacks. These methods allow attackers to access restricted directories and execute commands outside of the web server's root directory.

In conclusion, Apache Tomcat pentesting is a necessary process to ensure the security of web applications hosted on the server. It helps identify and fix security weaknesses, protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of online services.

Let's consider an example of a real but educational penetration testing scenario on an Apache Tomcat server.

1. **Information Gathering:** First, we identify the server's IP address and the version of Tomcat being used. For example, we can use the `nmap` tool to scan the server:

```
nmap -sV 192.168.1.10

```

This will provide output that includes the server's open ports and services running, including Tomcat and its version if it's running.

1. **Identifying Vulnerabilities:**
- **Weak or Default Credentials:** We can use a tool like `Hydra` to perform a brute force attack on the Tomcat server. This involves trying different combinations of usernames and passwords until the correct one is found. Here is an example command:
    
    ```
    hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt 192.168.1.10 http-get /manager/html
    
    ```
    
    In this example, `user.txt` and `pass.txt` are files containing a list of potential usernames and passwords, respectively.
    
- **Misconfigurations:** If the server allows directory listing, we can simply navigate to the server's IP address in a web browser and see if any directories are listed.
- **Outdated Software Versions:** We can check the version of Tomcat identified during the initial scan against a database of known vulnerabilities, such as the National Vulnerability Database.
1. **Exploitation:** Once we have identified a vulnerability, we can attempt to exploit it.
- **Default Credentials:** If we've identified the server as using default credentials, we can simply log into the Tomcat Manager App using a web browser and the credentials we've found.
- **Misconfigurations:** If the server allows directory listing, we can download any files in the directory simply by clicking on them in the browser. If the server is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, we might use a tool like `curl` to attempt to access restricted directories:
    
    ```
    curl <http://192.168.1.10/../../etc/passwd
    
    ```
    
    This example command attempts to access the `/etc/passwd` file, which is outside of the web server's root directory.
    
1. **Reporting:** Finally, we would document our findings and provide recommendations for mitigating the identified risks. This could include recommending stronger passwords, disabling directory listing, and updating Tomcat to the latest stable version.
