# Server Side Inclusion/Edge Side Inclusion Injection


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Server Side Inclusion (SSI) and Edge Side Includes (ESI) are technologies used in web servers and caches to include dynamic content into static web pages. However, they can also be exploited for malicious purposes, leading to SSI/ESI Injection attacks.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding SSI/ESI Injection is crucial as it can lead to serious security risks like data leakage, code execution on the server side, and even full system compromise. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or take control of the server.


### ⛏️ How ?

SSI/ESI Injection attacks can be prevented by using secure coding practices, validating and sanitizing user inputs, and implementing the latest security patches and updates. It's also advisable to use web application firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block suspicious activities.


### ⏳ When ?

SSI and ESI technologies have been widely used since the late 1990s and early 2000s. Therefore, the vulnerabilities and potential for injection attacks have been a concern for the same period.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

SSI/ESI Injection attacks occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious SSI or ESI directives into a web application's output. These directives can then be executed by the server or cache, leading to a variety of potential attacks. The severity and impact of such attacks depend on the specific technologies and configurations used by the web server and cache. For example, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server, read sensitive files, perform network requests, or carry out other malicious actions.
