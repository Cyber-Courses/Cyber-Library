# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Azure Key Vault works by providing a secure way to store and manage cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates. The keys are protected by Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). The secrets and certificates are encrypted before they're stored. Azure Key Vault uses RBAC (Role Based Access Control) to control who has access to the keys, secrets, and certificates. The vault also logs all activities, providing an audit trail that can be used to detect and respond to unauthorized access.
