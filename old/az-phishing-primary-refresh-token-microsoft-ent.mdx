---

In an Az-Phishing Primary Refresh Token attack, the attacker will typically send a phishing email to the target, tricking them into giving away their credentials. These credentials are then used to gain access to the PRT. Once the attacker obtains the PRT, they can access various resources within the Azure environment, posing a significant threat to data security. To mitigate this risk, it's crucial to secure the authentication process, monitor for suspicious activities, and educate employees on the importance of recognizing and avoiding phishing attempts.
