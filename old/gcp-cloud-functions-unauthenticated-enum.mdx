# GCP - Cloud Functions Unauthenticated Enum


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> GCP - Cloud Functions Unauthenticated Enum is a potential security issue where an attacker can list or enumerate all the available cloud functions in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project without authentication. This can expose sensitive information about the application's structure and functionality, which can be exploited to carry out more targeted attacks.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding and mitigating this issue is crucial as it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information. It allows attackers to gain insights into the application's structure, data flow, and functionality, which can be used to exploit other vulnerabilities, disrupt services, or exfiltrate data. Hence, it is crucial for developers and security professionals to understand this issue and take necessary precautions.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To mitigate this issue, it's important to implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms. Google Cloud Platform provides several security features including Identity and Access Management (IAM), which allows you to control who has what kind of access to which resources. You should restrict the 'cloudfunctions.functions.list' permission to trusted individuals or services. Also, regularly monitor and audit your GCP project for any suspicious activity.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The concept of enumeration and its potential threats have been known for a long time in the field of cybersecurity. However, with the advent of cloud services like GCP, the issue has taken on new dimensions and complexities. It's particularly relevant today, as more and more organizations are moving their infrastructure to the cloud.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

In the context of GCP - Cloud Functions Unauthenticated Enum, the underlying principle is the enumeration, which is a technique used in cybersecurity to gather information about a target. In this case, an attacker sends a request to the Google Cloud Platform's API endpoint for listing Cloud Functions without providing any authentication. If the GCP project is misconfigured and does not require proper authentication for this action, the attacker can get a list of all the available cloud functions. This information can be used to understand the application's structure and functionality, and to identify potential points of vulnerability.
