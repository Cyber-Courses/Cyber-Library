# Cookie Bomb + Onerror XS Leak


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Cookie Bomb and Onerror XS Leak are techniques used in cybersecurity. Cookie Bomb is a method of forcing a browser to store excessive data in cookies, potentially causing it to crash or malfunction. Onerror XS Leak, on the other hand, is a technique used to extract sensitive data from a user's browser by exploiting error handling procedures.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding these techniques is vital for both network security professionals and web developers. They highlight potential vulnerabilities in a system or application that can be exploited by malicious agents. Knowledge of these techniques can aid in the development of more secure systems and the implementation of robust security measures.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To prevent Cookie Bomb attacks, limit the size of cookies and the number of cookies that a browser can store. For Onerror XS Leak, ensure proper error handling procedures that don't reveal sensitive information. Regularly review and update security policies and carry out penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> These techniques have been in use for several years as part of the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. They are particularly relevant in the context of web applications and browser security.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Cookie Bomb works by sending a large number of Set-Cookie headers to a browser, filling up the limited space available for cookies. This can cause the browser to crash or behave unpredictably. Onerror XS Leak, on the other hand, exploits the error handling procedures of a web application. By intentionally causing an error and observing the resulting error message, an attacker can glean sensitive information about the system or its users. Both techniques require a careful balance between user convenience and security, and both can be mitigated with sound security practices and regular security audits.
