# Binary Exploitation


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Binary exploitation is a technique used in cybersecurity, it involves taking advantage of a program's flaws to control its behavior or output. It is often used to bypass security mechanisms, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary code.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding binary exploitation is crucial for both offensive and defensive security. For penetration testers (or 'red teamers'), it enables them to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, thereby helping to secure systems. For defenders (or 'blue teamers'), understanding how these attacks work can aid in detection and prevention.


### ⛏️ How ?

Binary exploitation often involves the following steps: 1. Identify a vulnerable program (this could be through code review, fuzzing, or other vulnerability discovery methods). 2. Understand the program's behavior and identify potential points of exploitation. 3. Develop an exploit that takes advantage of the vulnerability to achieve the desired outcome. 4. Test the exploit in a controlled environment before deployment.


### ⏳ When ?

Binary exploitation has been a core part of cybersecurity since the inception of computer systems. It saw a significant rise in use with the growth of the Internet and the increased interconnectivity of systems.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At its core, binary exploitation is about manipulating a program's control flow. This can be achieved through a number of techniques, with buffer overflow being one of the most common. Buffer overflow involves providing more input data than a program expects, causing it to overwrite memory and change its behavior. Other techniques include format string attacks, where a program's output is controlled by manipulating its input, and return-oriented programming, where an attacker reuses chunks of existing code to perform malicious actions. Each of these techniques relies on an understanding of the program's binary code and the underlying system architecture.
