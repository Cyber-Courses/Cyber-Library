# WebDav pentesting


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

WebDav pentesting refers to the process of testing the security of a WebDav server. WebDav (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is an extension of the HTTP protocol that allows for collaborative editing and file management on the web. The fundamental concepts underlying WebDav pentesting include understanding the HTTP protocol, the workings of a WebDav server, and the various attack vectors that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in a WebDav server.


### üßê¬†Why ?

WebDav servers are widely used for file sharing and collaborative work on the internet. If not properly secured, they can become a target for cyberattacks, leading to data breaches and other security incidents. Therefore, it's important to conduct penetration testing to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities. For readers, understanding WebDav pentesting can help in securing their own WebDav servers and understanding the potential threats in the cyber landscape.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To conduct WebDav pentesting, start by setting up a WebDav server for testing. Use tools like Nmap and Nikto for initial reconnaissance to find potential vulnerabilities. Then, proceed with exploiting these vulnerabilities using tools like Metasploit. Always remember to document your findings and the steps you took during the pentesting process. And finally, fix the identified vulnerabilities and verify the fixes by conducting a retest.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

WebDav pentesting has become increasingly important with the widespread use of WebDav servers for web-based file sharing and collaborative editing. The practice has been around since the introduction of WebDav in the late 1990s.

WebDav, standing for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, is an extension of the HTTP protocol that supports file upload, download, and management. This versatility makes it a common target for various types of cyberattacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

Pentesting, or penetration testing, is the process of testing a computer system, network or web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. In the context of WebDav, pentesting involves assessing the security of a WebDav server by mimicking the actions of an attacker.

During a WebDav pentest, security professionals look for various security weaknesses. These can include misconfigurations, weak authentication mechanisms, and outdated software versions. Each of these vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services.

A wide range of tools is used during the pentesting process. For instance, Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. It can be used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the system. In the context of WebDav pentesting, Nmap can help in identifying open ports and services running on the server.

Nikto, another vital tool, is an open-source web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs. It can help identify potential vulnerabilities in the WebDav server.

Metasploit is a powerful tool for exploiting identified vulnerabilities. It provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development. Upon identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, it is crucial to fix them promptly to prevent potential attacks.

After the fixes, it's important to conduct a retest to verify that the vulnerabilities were effectively addressed. This step ensures that the fixes not only resolve the known vulnerabilities but also don't introduce new ones.

In sum, WebDav pentesting is a comprehensive, multi-step process that plays a critical role in maintaining robust security in any organization that relies on WebDav servers for file sharing and collaborative editing.

Here is an example of a basic WebDav penetration testing process using Nmap, Nikto, and Metasploit:

1. **Reconnaissance with Nmap:** Begin by identifying open ports and running services on the target WebDav server using Nmap. An example command might be: `nmap -p 80,443 -T4 -A -v target_ip`. This command scans for open ports 80 and 443 on the target IP address and returns verbose output.
2. **Scanning with Nikto:** Once you've identified the open ports, use Nikto to scan for potential vulnerabilities. A typical Nikto command would be: `nikto -h http://target_ip`. This command scans the target IP address for vulnerabilities.
3. **Exploitation with Metasploit:** If Nikto identifies a vulnerability, you can use Metasploit to exploit it. First, start Metasploit with the command: `msfconsole`. Once in the Metasploit console, use the appropriate exploit module (based on the vulnerability identified). For example, if Nikto identified a vulnerability that can be exploited using the `exploit/multi/http/webdav_scanner` module, you would enter: `use exploit/multi/http/webdav_scanner` in the Metasploit console.
4. **Setting Exploit Options:** After choosing an exploit, set the options for the exploit. Typically, this includes setting the RHOSTS (remote hosts), which is the target IP address. For example, `set RHOSTS target_ip`.
5. **Running the Exploit:** Once the options are set, run the exploit by typing `run` or `exploit` in the Metasploit console.
6. **Post-Exploitation and Cleanup:** After successful exploitation, perform any post-exploitation actions necessary, such as gathering data or establishing persistence. Then, ensure that you clean up any changes made during testing and fix identified vulnerabilities.
7. **Retest:** After fixes, retest the system to ensure vulnerabilities were effectively addressed.

This process is a simplified example and should be adapted based on the specific environment and requirements. Always remember to obtain proper authorization before conducting any penetration testing.
