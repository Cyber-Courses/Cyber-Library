# GCP - Cloud Build Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Build Enum is a service that lets you execute builds on Google's infrastructure. Cloud Build Enum essentially allows users to define and list all the available builds within a specific GCP project.


### 🧐 Why ?

The GCP Cloud Build Enum is essential because it allows developers and security professionals to keep track of all the builds they have in a project. This can help to detect vulnerabilities, ensure security standards are being adhered to, and maintain order in large projects with many builds.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use GCP Cloud Build Enum, you need to have a GCP account and the necessary permissions to access and manage your projects. You can navigate to the Cloud Build section, and from there, you can list all your builds using the 'gcloud builds list' command in the GCP command line interface. The output will include details about each build, such as the build ID, status, source, and creation time.


### ⏳ When ?

GCP Cloud Build Enum became increasingly valuable with the rise of cloud-based development projects. Its importance is particularly prominent when managing large projects with numerous builds and when monitoring for security and compliance.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Cloud Build Enum works by querying the GCP API to fetch information about all the builds in a project. This information can be filtered and sorted based on various parameters like build status, creation time, etc. The list of builds can be output in various formats, including JSON and CSV, making it easy to further process or analyze the data. This feature is crucial for maintaining an overview of all the builds in a project, checking their status, and identifying potential issues early.
