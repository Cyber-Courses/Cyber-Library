# Dependency Confusion


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Dependency Confusion is a type of supply chain attack where an attacker publishes a package with the same name as a private package used by a company. When the company's software tries to fetch the package for installation, the public (malicious) one is downloaded and installed instead of the private package. This attack targets package managers of programming languages such as npm (Node.js), pip (Python), and RubyGems (Ruby).


### 🧐 Why ?

Dependency Confusion is important due to the increasing reliance on public package repositories in software development. This attack can lead to severe consequences, including the execution of arbitrary code, data theft, and even complete system takeover. Its ability to exploit the automated processes in modern software development makes it a significant threat to businesses and organizations.


### ⛏️ How ?

To protect yourself from Dependency Confusion, you should: 1) Use a private package repository and configure your package manager to prioritize it over public ones. 2) Regularly audit your software dependencies to identify potential vulnerabilities. 3) Implement security measures such as SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and SCA (Software Composition Analysis) to detect and mitigate potential threats in your software dependencies.


### ⏳ When ?

The concept of Dependency Confusion was introduced in 2021 by security researcher Alex Birsan, who discovered this attack vector and demonstrated its potential impact in a white-hat hacking experiment. Since then, the cybersecurity industry has been actively addressing this issue.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Dependency Confusion is based on the 'dependency hell' problem in software development, where managing the interdependence of various software packages becomes complex. Package managers, which are designed to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages, often prioritize public packages over private ones in case of a naming conflict. This behaviour is exploited in a Dependency Confusion attack. The attacker publishes a malicious package in a public repository with the same name as a private package used by a target company. When the company's build system fetches the package, it inadvertently downloads and installs the malicious one. The malicious package can contain arbitrary code, which gets executed in the company's environment, leading to potential data theft, system disruption, or other harmful activities.
