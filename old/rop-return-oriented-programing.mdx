# ROP - Return Oriented Programing


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) is a security exploit technique that allows an attacker to control a system by reusing chunks of legitimate code, called 'gadgets', that already exist in the system's memory.


### 🧐 Why ?

ROP is important because it enables attackers to bypass security defenses, such as non-executable stack protection and software-based fault isolation, which are designed to prevent malicious code from being executed. Understanding ROP is critical for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity professionals.


### ⛏️ How ?

ROP is typically used in the exploitation phase of a cyber attack. After exploiting a vulnerability to gain control of the program counter, an attacker constructs a 'ROP chain' of gadgets to perform arbitrary operations. Each gadget is a sequence of instructions followed by a return instruction, allowing the attacker to control the program's execution flow. Defending against ROP involves techniques such as code randomization and gadget elimination.


### ⏳ When ?

ROP was first proposed in 2007 as a method to bypass the non-executable stack protection mechanism. Since then, it has been widely used in various forms of cyber attacks.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, ROP involves manipulating the call stack to redirect the program's control flow. Once the attacker has control over the stack, they can change the sequence of function calls and returns. They achieve this by overwriting the return addresses on the stack with addresses of useful instructions (the gadgets) scattered throughout the program. When the program executes a return instruction, it pops the top value from the stack and jumps to that address, executing the gadget. By carefully selecting and ordering these gadgets, the attacker can perform arbitrary operations.
