# Grafana pentesting


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

> Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. In the context of pentesting, Grafana can be used to visualize data from security scans, making it easier to identify vulnerabilities.
> 

### 🧐 Why ?

> Grafana pentesting is important because it provides a visual representation of your network's security. It allows you to easily identify vulnerabilities and weak points in your system. This is crucial in cybersecurity as it aids in the proactive identification and mitigation of potential threats.
> 

### ⛏️ How ?

> To use Grafana for pentesting, you first need to install Grafana and integrate it with your data source (e.g., a security scanner like Nessus or OpenVAS). Then, configure a dashboard to display the data from your security scans. The specifics will depend on your data source and what you're trying to visualize.

### ⏳ When ?

> Grafana has been used in the field of cybersecurity for several years. Its flexibility and wide range of data source integrations make it a popular choice for visualizing security data. As cybersecurity threats become more advanced, the use of tools like Grafana for pentesting will likely become increasingly common.

# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Grafana is a powerful open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application that provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources. It is expandable through a plug-in system and can be integrated into systems for creating complex time series dashboards.

In penetration testing (pentesting), Grafana becomes a critical tool due to its ability to visualize data, which makes analysing security scans more straightforward and efficient. It can be integrated with various data sources like Nessus and OpenVAS, among others, which provide valuable data about potential vulnerabilities in a system.

The versatility of Grafana lies in its query language, allowing the selection and aggregation of metrics from these data sources. Using these metrics, Grafana's visualization features enable the creation of graphs, charts, and alerts, providing a comprehensive visual representation of the data.

This visual representation greatly aids in the interpretation of security scan results, as potential vulnerabilities can be identified more easily and quickly, thus enabling faster response times to potential threats.

Additionally, Grafana's alerting feature provides timely notifications about crucial changes in the system's status, enabling immediate attention and action before a small vulnerability turns into a significant security issue.

In summary, Grafana is an invaluable tool in the cybersecurity field due to its ability to aggregate, visualize, and alert on data in a comprehensive, interactive, and user-friendly manner. The tool's adaptability and integrative capabilities make it a popular choice for handling and visualizing security data during pentesting.

Let's assume we are using Grafana for penetration testing (pentesting) with a data source from OpenVAS.

1. **Installation:** First, you need to install Grafana. You can do this on a Linux system with the following command: `sudo apt-get install -y grafana`.
2. **Start Grafana:** After installing, you can start Grafana using the command: `systemctl start grafana-server`.
3. **OpenVAS Integration:** To integrate Grafana with OpenVAS, you need to install the OpenVAS data source plugin. A command example: `grafana-cli plugins install jangaraj-openvas-datasource`.
4. **Configure Data Source:** Now, you need to configure Grafana to use OpenVAS as a data source. This is done in Grafana's web interface, typically accessible at `localhost:3000`. Click on 'Configuration' -> 'Data Sources' -> 'Add data source', select 'OpenVAS', and fill in the details such as the OpenVAS server URL and credentials.
5. **Create Dashboard:** Once the data source is set up, you can create a dashboard. Go to 'Create' -> 'Dashboard', add a new panel, and select the OpenVAS data source. In the metric query input, you can input something like `Vulnerability Score`, which will show a graph of the vulnerability scores from your OpenVAS scans.
6. **Set Alerts:** In the panel edit mode, you can set up alerts by going to the 'Alert' tab. Here, you can configure conditions like `IF avg() OF query(A, 5m, now) IS ABOVE 4`, which would trigger an alert if the average vulnerability score over the last 5 minutes is above 4.

This is a simple overview and actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements of your pentesting project.
