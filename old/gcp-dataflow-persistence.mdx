# GCP - Dataflow Persistence


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Dataflow Persistence is a feature within GCP's Dataflow service that allows for the reliable processing of large amounts of data in real-time or batch mode. It is designed to provide fault-tolerant and consistent computations by persisting intermediate results and snapshots of data.


### 🧐 Why ?

Dataflow Persistence is important because it guarantees data processing integrity and prevents data loss in case of failures, making it vital for businesses dealing with large volumes of data. It can be particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be processed and analyzed in real-time, such as in financial services, healthcare, or e-commerce systems where timely and accurate data processing is crucial.


### ⛏️ How ?

To leverage Dataflow Persistence, you would typically start by creating a Dataflow job in the GCP console. During the configuration of your job, you can specify the frequency at which your data should be persisted or snapshot. Once the job is running, Dataflow automatically manages the persistence of your data, providing you with the flexibility to process large volumes of data without worrying about data loss or inconsistency.


### ⏳ When ?

Dataflow Persistence was introduced as part of the Dataflow service when it was launched by Google in 2014. It has since become a key feature for businesses leveraging GCP for large scale data processing tasks.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At its core, Dataflow Persistence works by periodically snapshotting the state of a Dataflow pipeline. These snapshots include the state of all computations within the pipeline, and the position of all input sources. In the event of a failure, these snapshots can be used to restore the pipeline to a consistent state. This ensures that all data is processed exactly once, even in the presence of failures. Furthermore, the persistence of intermediate results allows for efficient processing of large data sets by reducing the need for recomputation.
