# GCP - Cloud Run Unauthenticated Enum


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Google Cloud Run Unauthenticated Enumeration (GCP Cloud Run Unauth Enum) is a security issue where an attacker can list all the services deployed in a Google Cloud Run environment without needing authentication. The fundamental concept behind this issue is the improper implementation of access controls on the Google Cloud Run API, allowing unauthorized access to information.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding GCP Cloud Run Unauth Enum is important as it poses a significant security risk. If exploited, it can lead to information disclosure, revealing sensitive details about the services running in your Google Cloud environment. This information can be used by attackers to further exploit your systems, leading to potential data breaches or system compromise.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use GCP Cloud Run Unauth Enum to your advantage, you should ensure that you have proper access controls in place for your Google Cloud Run API. This involves setting up proper permissions and roles for your Google Cloud Run services and ensuring that only authorized users can access your Cloud Run services. Additionally, regularly monitor your Cloud Run environment for any unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The practice of securing your Google Cloud Run environment against unauthenticated enumeration should start as soon as you begin deploying services in it. However, if you have not done so yet, it is never too late to start.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

GCP Cloud Run Unauth Enum is based on the principle of 'enumeration', which is a common technique used in security testing to gather information about a target system. In this case, the target system is the Google Cloud Run environment. Due to improper access controls on the Cloud Run API, an attacker can enumerate, or list, all the services deployed in the environment without needing to authenticate themselves. This can reveal sensitive information such as service names, versions, and configurations, which can then be used for further attacks. To mitigate this issue, proper access controls should be implemented on the Cloud Run API, and regular monitoring should be carried out to detect any unauthorized access.
