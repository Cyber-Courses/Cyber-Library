# GCP - Storage Unauthenticated Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - Storage Unauthenticated Enumeration (SUE) refers to a security issue where an unauthenticated user can enumerate (or list) all the storage buckets in a GCP project. This is possible due to a misconfiguration of the access control settings of the storage buckets.


### 🧐 Why ?

The importance of understanding GCP - SUE lies in its potential for exploitation. If an attacker can list your storage buckets, they can potentially access sensitive data, or manipulate the data in your buckets. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or even Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if the attacker fills up your storage space. This is especially concerning in the context of cloud computing where data is often the most valuable asset.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use GCP - SUE to your advantage, it is important to ensure that your buckets are properly configured to prevent unauthorized access. This involves setting the appropriate access control permissions on your buckets, regularly auditing your bucket permissions, and ensuring that any data you store is appropriately protected (e.g., through encryption).


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of securing GCP storage buckets has been a concern since the introduction of cloud storage services. However, the specific issue of unauthenticated enumeration has become more prominent with the increasing use of cloud services and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP - SUE works by taking advantage of the fact that GCP storage buckets are globally unique and are accessible through a predictable URL. If the 'Uniform' bucket-level access control setting is enabled, anyone who knows the bucket's URL can list the objects in the bucket. An attacker can therefore enumerate the storage buckets in a GCP project by guessing bucket names and attempting to access them. If the bucket is not properly secured, the attacker will be able to list its contents.
