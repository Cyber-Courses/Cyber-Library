# GCP - Storage Post Exploitation


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Storage Post Exploitation refers to the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in a GCP Storage system after gaining initial access. It involves taking advantage of misconfigurations or weaknesses within the GCP storage to further compromise the system, gain escalated privileges, or access restricted data.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP Storage Post Exploitation is vital as it helps to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities in a GCP storage system that could be exploited by malicious actors. This knowledge is essential for organizations to secure their cloud storage systems and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.


### ⛏️ How ?

To implement GCP Storage Post Exploitation, one must first gain initial access to the GCP Storage system. This can be done by exploiting weak credentials, misconfigurations, or other vulnerabilities. Once access is gained, further exploitation can be conducted by taking advantage of insecure permissions, misconfigured security settings or other weaknesses within the storage system.


### ⏳ When ?

GCP Storage Post Exploitation began being practiced as organizations started moving their data storage to the cloud. As cloud storage systems like GCP became more popular, they also became a target for attackers, leading to the development of post exploitation techniques to further compromise these systems.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Storage Post Exploitation involves a series of steps. First, an attacker gains initial access to the GCP Storage system, usually by exploiting a vulnerability or weak security configuration. Once inside, the attacker can then perform a variety of actions depending on the specific vulnerabilities present. For example, they may be able to escalate their privileges, giving them more control over the system, or they may be able to access and exfiltrate sensitive data.
