# Azure Pentesting


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

> Azure Pentesting refers to the practice of testing the security of Microsoft Azure Cloud services. It involves simulating attacks to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
> 

### 🧐 Why ?

> Azure Pentesting is essential because it helps organizations identify and remediate security vulnerabilities within their Azure environments. This can prevent potential data breaches and ensure that the organization's cloud resources are secure.
> 

### ⛏️ How ?

> Azure Pentesting involves several steps, including reconnaissance, where the pentester gathers information about the target; scanning and enumeration, where the pentester identifies potential attack vectors; and exploitation, where the pentester attempts to breach the system using identified vulnerabilities. Finally, the pentester documents their findings and provides a report to the organization.
> 

### ⏳ When ?

> Azure Pentesting should be performed periodically to ensure continued security as new vulnerabilities may arise over time. It's also especially important to conduct a pentest after major changes to the Azure environment, such as the introduction of new services or applications.

# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Azure Pentesting involves a number of technical concepts and tools. During the reconnaissance phase, pentesters may use tools like Nmap and Wireshark to gather information about the target. During the scanning and enumeration phase, they may use tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to identify potential vulnerabilities. During the exploitation phase, they may use tools like Metasploit or Burp Suite to try and exploit these vulnerabilities. Finally, during the reporting phase, they will compile their findings into a comprehensive report detailing the vulnerabilities found, the potential impact, and recommended remediation steps.
