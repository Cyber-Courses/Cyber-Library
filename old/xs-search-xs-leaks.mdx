# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

XS-Search and XS-Leaks exploit the web browser's mechanisms for processing cross-origin requests. By initiating a cross-origin request, an attacker can infer sensitive information based on the timing, size, or other indirect signals of the server's responses. For instance, an attacker can use timing attacks to infer whether a user is logged into a certain website, or use response size to guess the user's search history on a search engine.
