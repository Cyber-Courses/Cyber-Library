# Az - Azure App Service & Function Apps


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Azure App Service and Function Apps are cloud-based services provided by Microsoft for developing, hosting, and scaling web applications and APIs. Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for creating and deploying cloud applications, whereas Azure Function Apps is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to provision or manage infrastructure.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> The importance of Azure App Service and Function Apps lies in their ability to simplify the development and deployment of web applications and APIs. They provide a scalable, secure, and fully managed platform that allows developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure. This can significantly reduce the time and cost of application development and deployment. Furthermore, with Azure Function Apps, you only pay for the time your code runs, making it a cost-effective solution for many scenarios.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use Azure App Service or Function Apps, you need to create an Azure account and set up a subscription. Once you have an account, you can create an App Service or Function App through the Azure portal. You can then deploy your code using Git, FTP, or other deployment options. You can also set up automatic scaling, custom domains, SSL certificates, and other features as needed. For Function Apps, you write code that gets triggered by events, and Azure takes care of running it whenever the event occurs.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Azure App Service was launched by Microsoft in 2015 as part of the Azure cloud platform. Azure Function Apps were introduced a year later, in 2016, as part of the growing trend of serverless computing.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Both Azure App Service and Function Apps are based on the concept of cloud computing, where computing resources are provided as a service over the internet. They both leverage the scalability, reliability, and security of Azure's underlying infrastructure to provide a platform for developing and deploying applications and APIs. However, they differ in how they manage resources. With App Service, you reserve a certain amount of resources for your app, and you pay for these resources whether your app is running or not. With Function Apps, on the other hand, your code is run on-demand, and you only pay for the compute time you use. This makes Function Apps a good fit for workloads that have variable demand or are event-driven.
