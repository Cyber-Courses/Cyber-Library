# GCP - Resourcemanager Privesc


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Resourcemanager is a set of tools that allows for the management of resources within the platform. It enables users to create, delete, and manage Google Cloud resources like projects, folders, and organizations. Privilege escalation or 'privesc' refers to a situation where a user gains more access rights or privileges than they were initially granted, often exploiting system vulnerabilities. In the context of GCP, Resourcemanager Privesc refers to a scenario where an attacker gains escalated privileges allowing them to manipulate resources within the GCP environment.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding Resourcemanager Privesc is important because GCP is widely used by businesses and organizations worldwide. If an attacker gains escalated privileges, they can tamper with resources, steal sensitive data, and wreak havoc within the cloud environment. Therefore, understanding this concept is essential for both developing secure applications and ensuring the security of existing systems.


### ⛏️ How ?

To prevent Resourcemanager Privesc, it's important to follow best practices for GCP security. This includes applying the principle of least privilege (PoLP), which involves giving a user account or process only those privileges which are essential to perform its intended function. Regularly auditing and monitoring access rights can also help identify and mitigate potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Additionally, using tools like Google's Identity Platform can help manage authentication and access control.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of cloud platforms like GCP has increased significantly over the past decade, making Resourcemanager Privesc a growing concern. As businesses continue to migrate to the cloud, the importance of understanding and mitigating this threat will only increase.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

When a user or service has more privileges than necessary, it opens up avenues for potential abuse, whether intentional or unintentional. In GCP, an attacker could manipulate the Resourcemanager to escalate their privileges and gain unauthorized access to resources. This could be done through several ways, such as exploiting a misconfiguration, using social engineering tactics to trick users into granting additional permissions, or finding and exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once the attacker has escalated their privileges, they could perform malicious activities like modifying resources, exfiltrating data, or disrupting services.
