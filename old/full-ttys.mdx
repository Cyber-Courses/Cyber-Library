# Full TTYs


# üëâ¬†Overview

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Full TTYs, or full teletype systems, are a type of terminal emulator. This was originally a hardware device that allowed users to interact with a computer system, but in modern computing, it's often a software program that emulates the functionality of the original hardware.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Understanding Full TTYs is important because they are used to provide an interface for users to interact with a computer system. They handle the input and output between the user and the system, allowing for command-line interfaces, shell scripting, and other important functions. For cybersecurity professionals, Full TTYs are often used in shell scripting and exploitation.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

Full TTYs can be used in various ways depending on the operating system. In Unix-like systems such as Linux or MacOS, Full TTYs can be accessed via the terminal program. In Windows, Full TTYs can be accessed via programs like PowerShell. To use a Full TTY, one usually types commands at the prompt and presses enter, and the system will execute the command and return the result.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Full TTYs have been in use since the early days of computing. They were originally physical devices, but with the advent of modern operating systems, they have largely been replaced by software emulators. However, the basic principles of operation remain the same.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Full TTYs, or full teletype systems, emulate the functionality of original hardware terminals in a software environment. They are a critical component of modern computing, especially in Unix-like systems like Linux or MacOS, and Windows via programs like PowerShell.

At its core, a Full TTY works by receiving user input, typically text commands, and forwarding it to the system for processing. The system executes the command and returns the result, which the Full TTY then displays to the user. This interaction happens within a command-line interface, a user-friendly environment that facilitates direct communication between the user and the system.

In cybersecurity, Full TTYs have a special significance. They are often employed in shell scripting, a powerful tool that enables automation of tasks. This can simplify the management of systems and also open up possibilities for system exploitation if not properly secured, making Full TTYs a double-edged sword.

In essence, Full TTYs serve as an interface that bridges the gap between users and the system, allowing for direct, efficient interaction. Understanding their operation is crucial not only for effective system usage but also for securing systems against potential attack vectors.

Consider a scenario where you need to create a directory and list its contents on a Unix-like system using a Full TTY. Here are the steps:

1. **Open the Terminal**: This is your access point to the Full TTY. It's usually found in the utilities section of your applications.
2. **Type the 'mkdir' command**: 'mkdir' stands for 'make directory'. If you wanted to create a directory named 'example_dir', you would type `mkdir example_dir` at the prompt and press enter.

```bash
$ mkdir example_dir

```

1. **Verify the directory is created**: You can do this by listing the contents of the current directory using the 'ls' command. If 'example_dir' shows up in the output, the directory was successfully created.

```bash
$ ls
example_dir

```

This example showcases how Full TTYs receive user input (the 'mkdir' and 'ls' commands), forward it to the system for processing, and display the result (the creation of 'example_dir' and its appearance in the directory listing).

In a cybersecurity context, assume you have a shell script that backs up a directory to prevent data loss in case of a system crash. The script could use Full TTY commands like 'cp' (copy) and 'cron' (time-based job scheduler) to automate the backup process. A simplified version of such a script might look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cp -r /path/to/original/directory /path/to/backup/directory

```

This script copies the contents of the original directory to the backup directory. It shows how Full TTYs can be used to automate tasks, but also why they must be secured: if a malicious actor gains access to your Full TTY, they could create a similar script to copy sensitive data to their own server.
