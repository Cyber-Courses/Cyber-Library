# Attempt to Mount the Host's Filesystem


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

An attempt to mount the host's filesystem is essentially an effort to access the host's file system from a guest operating system in a virtual machine or containerized environment. This can be a necessary step in certain legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also represent a security risk if unauthorized users or malicious software gain access to the host's file system.


### üßê¬†Why ?

This topic is of importance due to the security implications it carries. If a malicious actor or program gains access to the host's file system, they can potentially access, modify, or delete any data stored on it. This could lead to data loss, corruption, or exposure of sensitive information. Therefore, understanding the concept of mounting the host's filesystem and how it can be properly managed and secured is crucial for anyone working with virtual machines or containerized environments.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To mount a host's filesystem, one typically needs administrative privileges on the guest operating system. The process involves invoking specific system commands or using specialized software tools. However, from a security perspective, it's important to restrict the ability to mount the host's filesystem only to trusted administrators. This can be achieved through proper user rights management, use of secure and isolated environments, and regular system audits.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The practice of mounting a host's filesystem has been prevalent ever since virtual machines and containerized systems came into popular use. This dates back to the late 1990s and early 2000s when virtualization technology began to mature.

Mounting a host's filesystem from a guest OS is a complex process that involves multiple layers of software. It starts with the guest OS, which is the operating system running inside the virtual machine or container. This OS needs to interact with the host's filesystem, which is outside of its usual scope.

This interaction is made possible by an abstraction layer provided by the virtualization or containerization software. This layer essentially 'fools' the guest OS into thinking that it's interacting with its own local filesystem, when in reality it's interacting with the host's filesystem.

The actual interaction between the guest OS and the host's filesystem is typically done using system calls. A system call is a request in a Unix-like operating system made via a software interrupt by an active process for a service performed by the kernel. These system calls are intercepted and handled by the hypervisor or container runtime, which is the software that manages the virtual machines or containers.

When the system calls are intercepted, the hypervisor or container runtime translates them into actions on the host's filesystem. The filesystem of the host is then exposed to the guest as if it were a local resource. This allows the guest OS to read from and write to the host's filesystem as if it were its own.

However, this process can lead to security issues. If the guest OS is compromised, for example by a hacker or malicious software, it could potentially give them access to the host's filesystem. This is because the guest OS has been given the ability to read from and write to the host's filesystem. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive data on the host, or even to modify or delete data, leading to potential data loss or corruption.

Therefore, it's crucial that this process is managed securely. This can involve restricting the ability to mount the host's filesystem to trusted administrators, using secure and isolated environments, and conducting regular system audits to detect any potential security breaches.

Let's take an example of mounting a host's filesystem in a Docker container, which is a common scenario in the real world.

1. **Creating a Docker Volume**: A Docker volume is a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. You create a volume using the `docker volume create` command. Let's say we create a volume named "myvol".
    
    ```
    docker volume create myvol
    
    ```
    
2. **Mounting the Volume**: Now, we can mount this volume to a Docker container. When we run a container, we use the `v` flag to bind the volume to a specific directory within the container. In this case, we're binding "myvol" to "/app" in the container.
    
    ```
    docker run -d -v myvol:/app ubuntu
    
    ```
    
3. **Interacting with the Filesystem**: Inside the container, the "/app" directory now corresponds to the "myvol" volume on the host. Any changes made to the "/app" directory from within the container will affect the "myvol" volume. This means that the guest OS (Ubuntu in this case) is now capable of interacting with the host's filesystem (through the "myvol" volume).

In terms of security, Docker provides some mechanisms to restrict access to volumes. For instance, you can set the `:ro` flag when mounting a volume to make it read-only within the container.

```bash
docker run -d -v myvol:/app:ro ubuntu

```

This command mounts the volume as read-only, preventing the container from making changes to the host's filesystem. It's important to ensure that only trusted administrators have the ability to create and manage Docker volumes to prevent unauthorized access to the host's filesystem.
