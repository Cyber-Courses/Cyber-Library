# Basic Forensic Methodology


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Basic Forensic Methodology refers to the systematic and scientific approach taken in the collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence in the context of a crime or a legal proceeding. It is built on foundational principles such as the Locard's Exchange Principle, which states that every contact leaves a trace, and the Principle of Individuality, which asserts that every object, by virtue of its existence, is unique and distinguishable.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Understanding Basic Forensic Methodology is crucial because it forms the basis for any digital forensic investigation. It is used to solve a range of problems such as uncovering the source of a data breach, recovering lost or deleted data, and identifying and analyzing malware attacks. It is also essential for the legal process, where digital evidence must be handled and presented in a way that meets the standards of admissibility in court. Therefore, anyone involved in cybersecurity, law enforcement, or legal proceedings involving digital evidence should be interested in this topic.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To implement Basic Forensic Methodology, one can follow these steps: \n1. Identification: Identify the need for a digital forensic investigation. \n2. Preservation: Secure and preserve the digital evidence to prevent any alteration or loss. \n3. Collection: Collect the digital evidence using approved methods and tools. \n4. Analysis: Analyze the collected evidence to extract relevant information. \n5. Presentation: Prepare a report of the findings that can be understood by non-technical individuals.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Basic Forensic Methodology began to be used with the advent of digital forensics in the late 20th century, as computers and digital devices started playing a significant role in daily life and crime. Its use has grown exponentially with the rise in cybercrime and the increasing reliance on digital evidence in legal proceedings.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

A thorough understanding of Basic Forensic Methodology involves an in-depth study of the specific techniques and tools used in each stage of the process. These stages include identifying the need for investigation, preserving and securing digital evidence, collecting the evidence using approved methods, analyzing the collected evidence, and preparing a comprehensive report.

Each stage requires adherence to strict standards and guidelines to ensure the integrity and admissibility of digital evidence. For instance, preserving digital evidence involves creating a forensic copy of the evidence and maintaining a chain of custody. Collecting evidence entails the use of specialized tools that can retrieve even deleted or hidden data without changing the original data.

Analyzing the evidence requires expertise in different areas, such as file systems, network protocols, and various operating systems. The analysis also involves overcoming challenges such as encryption, data volume, and anti-forensic techniques that aim to hinder the investigation.

Moreover, Basic Forensic Methodology involves understanding the legal and ethical considerations in digital forensics. This includes respecting privacy rights, obtaining necessary permissions, and following the law when conducting forensic investigations.

Case studies, practical examples, and references to relevant research and legislation can provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic. These may include examples of how digital forensic methodology has been used to solve real-world cases, how different tools and techniques work, and how legislation impacts digital forensics.

An example of applying Basic Forensic Methodology in a real-world scenario could be investigating a data breach.

1. Identification: The need for an investigation arises when a company identifies that their data has been accessed or stolen. This could be identified by unusual network activity, alerts from intrusion detection systems, or reports from employees or customers.
2. Preservation: The first step in preserving the digital evidence would be to take an image of the affected systems using a tool like 'dd'. This is a command-line utility in Unix and Linux that can be used to make a bit-by-bit copy of a disk. The command might look something like this:
    
    `dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/image.img bs=4M`
    
    In this command, 'if' specifies the input file (in this case, the disk to be copied), 'of' specifies the output file (the disk image to be created), and 'bs' is the block size.
    
3. Collection: Once the evidence has been preserved, it can be collected for analysis. This could involve using file carving tools like 'foremost' to recover files, even if they've been deleted. A command might look like this:
    
    `foremost -i /path/to/image.img -o /path/to/output/directory`
    
    In this command, 'i' specifies the input file (the disk image), and 'o' specifies the output directory where the recovered files will be saved.
    
4. Analysis: The collected evidence is then analyzed. This might involve examining logs to identify suspicious activity, analyzing network traffic using a tool like Wireshark, or looking at file metadata to identify when a file was accessed or modified.
5. Presentation: The findings are then compiled into a report that explains the facts of the case in a clear and understandable manner. This report would detail the steps taken in the investigation, present the evidence found, and explain how the conclusions were reached.

This entire process must be conducted following legal and ethical guidelines, ensuring the privacy rights of individuals are respected, and necessary permissions are obtained.
