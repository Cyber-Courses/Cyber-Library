# hop-by-hop headers


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Hop-by-hop headers are a type of HTTP headers that are used in the process of transmitting data over the internet. These headers are not stored by proxies and are only forwarded by proxies. They are crucial for securing and managing the transmission of data packets over the network.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding hop-by-hop headers is vital as they play a crucial role in the communication process over the internet. They help manage the data transmission process, ensuring that the data packets reach their intended destination correctly and securely. They are also important for troubleshooting network issues as they provide information about the path taken by the data packets. Without these headers, the data transmission process over the internet would be less secure and efficient.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use hop-by-hop headers, you need to understand their structure and how they function. These headers are added to the HTTP message and include information such as the transmission control protocol (TCP), the internet protocol (IP), and other relevant data. They are then read and processed by each node (or 'hop') in the network path. The node uses this information to decide how to handle the data packet before forwarding it to the next node in the path.


### ⏳ When ?

Hop-by-hop headers have been in use since the inception of the HTTP/1.1 protocol in the late 1990s. They continue to be used in modern internet communication protocols, including HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

A hop-by-hop header is part of the HTTP protocol that is used for the transmission of data packets over a network. Every time a data packet is forwarded from one node to another (a process known as 'hopping'), the hop-by-hop header is read and processed by the node. This header includes information such as the transmission control protocol (TCP), the internet protocol (IP), and other relevant data. The node uses this information to decide how to handle the data packet before forwarding it to the next node in the path. Hop-by-hop headers are designed to be transient, meaning they are not stored by proxies and are only used for the duration of the transmission process. They are essential for managing and securing the data transmission process, as they provide information about the path taken by the data packets and help ensure that the packets reach their intended destination correctly and securely.
