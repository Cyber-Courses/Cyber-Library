# NoSQL injection


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

> NoSQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its NoSQL database. It generally involves the injection of malicious code into a program, which is then passed to the NoSQL database for execution. Unlike SQL injection, which targets SQL databases, NoSQL injection attacks target NoSQL databases, which are increasingly being used in web and mobile applications for their flexible schema and scalability.
> 

### 🧐 Why ?

> Understanding NoSQL injection is crucial because the use of NoSQL databases is on the rise, and so are the potential security threats related to them. As NoSQL databases don't use the SQL language for querying, many developers and organizations mistakenly believe they are exempt from classic SQL injection attacks. However, NoSQL databases have their own query languages and APIs, which are still susceptible to injection attacks. Failing to address this vulnerability can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, and other serious implications.

### ⛏️ How ?

> To protect against NoSQL injection, one should follow secure coding practices such as input validation, parameterized queries, and use of appropriate APIs. Regularly updating and patching the NoSQL database can also help in mitigating the risk. Additionally, using a web application firewall (WAF) and conducting regular security audits can also help in identifying and fixing any potential vulnerabilities.
> 

### ⏳ When ?

> The use of NoSQL databases became more prevalent with the rise of big data in the late 2000s and early 2010s. As a result, NoSQL injection attacks have also emerged as a significant security threat in recent years.

# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

NoSQL injection attacks exploit the fact that NoSQL databases use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to query data. An attacker can manipulate these queries by inserting malicious JSON code. The extent of the damage depends on the capabilities provided by the NoSQL database to the application. In worst-case scenarios, an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system. Understanding the underlying principles of how NoSQL databases query data and how they differ from SQL databases is key to identifying potential vulnerabilities and implementing effective security measures.
