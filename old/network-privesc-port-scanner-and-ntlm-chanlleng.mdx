# Network - Privesc, Port Scanner and NTLM chanllenge response disclosure


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Network privilege escalation (Network - Privesc), port scanning, and NTLM challenge-response disclosure are interconnected concepts in the realm of network security and cybersecurity. Network - Privesc involves the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a network system to gain higher access privileges. A port scanner is a software application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. These open ports can be used to gain unauthorized access or retrieve sensitive information. NTLM Challenge-Response disclosure refers to the potential vulnerability wherein an attacker can intercept the NTLM responses, reverse-engineer them and potentially gain unauthorized access to a system.

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Network - Privesc, Port Scanning, and NTLM Challenge-Response disclosure are critical aspects of network security. Cybercriminals are always on the lookout for potential vulnerabilities to exploit for malicious purposes, such as data theft, service disruption, or unauthorized system access. Understanding these concepts is crucial for both cybersecurity professionals and system administrators to protect their networks against potential attacks, as well as for ethical hackers to identify and address these vulnerabilities.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To protect against Network - Privesc, system administrators should regularly update and patch their systems, limit user privileges, and monitor system logs. Port Scanning can be counteracted by using firewall rules, intrusion detection systems, and regular network auditing. NTLM Challenge-Response disclosure can be prevented by implementing encryption, secure communication protocols, and avoiding the use of weak passwords. Ethical hackers and cybersecurity professionals can use these vulnerabilities to identify weak points, conduct penetration testing and harden the network security.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> These concepts have been in use since the inception of networked computing systems. With the proliferation of Internet-connected devices and the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, their importance has only grown over time.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

In a Network - Privesc attack, an attacker would typically first gain access to a network with lower-level privileges and then exploit a vulnerability to escalate their privileges. Port scanners work by sending a message to each port, one at a time. The responses they receive from each port determine whether the port is in use. In the case of NTLM Challenge-Response disclosure, when a client wants to access a resource, it sends an NTLM Negotiate message to the server. The server responds with an NTLM Challenge, which the client responds to with an NTLM Authenticate message. If an attacker intercepts this process, they can potentially reverse-engineer the responses and gain unauthorized access to the system.
