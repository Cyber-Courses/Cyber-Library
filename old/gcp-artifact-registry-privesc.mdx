# GCP - Artifact Registry Privesc


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> GCP Artifact Registry Privesc is a security concern related to the Google Cloud Platform's Artifact Registry, where a user with lower-level permissions can potentially elevate their access privileges. The Artifact Registry is a scalable and managed service that allows organizations to store, manage, and secure software packages.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding GCP Artifact Registry Privesc is crucial due to its potential for misuse and consequential security implications. If not properly managed and monitored, vulnerability to privilege escalation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of services, and even full control over the affected resources.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To prevent GCP Artifact Registry Privesc, organizations should regularly audit and monitor user actions, especially in relation to privilege assignments. They should also enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users have only the permissions they need to perform their tasks. Lastly, employing multi-factor authentication and strong password policies can provide an extra layer of security.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The use of Artifact Registry on GCP and the subsequent need for understanding and mitigating the associated Privesc risks became prominent as more organizations started to move their operations onto cloud platforms for scalability and efficiency.
> 

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

GCP Artifact Registry Privesc involves exploiting the permissions associated with the Artifact Registry, a service on Google's Cloud Platform that lets users store, manage, and secure software packages. When a user with lesser privileges gains elevated access, they may perform actions that are otherwise restricted, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or service disruptions. This happens due to misconfigurations in the access control policies or due to vulnerabilities in the system that are exploited. Mitigation strategies include regular audits of user actions and permissions, enforcing the principle of least privilege, and using multi-factor authentication.
