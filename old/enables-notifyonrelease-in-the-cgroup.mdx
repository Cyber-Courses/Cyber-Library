# Enables notify_on_release in the cgroup


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

The 'notify_on_release' is a parameter in the cgroup filesystem in Linux. Cgroup, short for control groups, is a kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of a collection of processes. When 'notify_on_release' is enabled (set to 1), a release agent will be called when the last task in a cgroup has exited.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Understanding 'notify_on_release' is important as it is a mechanism that can help in managing resources effectively in a Linux system. For instance, it can be used to clean up resources when they are no longer needed, which can help prevent resource leaks and keep the system running efficiently.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To use 'notify_on_release', you first need to navigate to the directory of the cgroup you are interested in. Then, you can enable 'notify_on_release' by echoing 1 into the 'notify_on_release' file. For example: `echo 1 /sys/fs/cgroup/my_cgroup/notify_on_release`. After this, when the last task in the 'my_cgroup' cgroup exits, the release agent specified in the 'release_agent' file of the root cgroup will be called.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The 'notify_on_release' feature has been available since the introduction of cgroups in the Linux kernel in 2007. It is a low-level feature that is often used indirectly through higher level tools and systems such as Docker and Kubernetes, which use cgroups to isolate their workloads.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

The 'notify_on_release' flag is a crucial part of cgroup management in Linux. It's a mechanism that triggers the execution of a specified 'release_agent' when a cgroup becomes empty, meaning there are no more tasks (processes) left in it. The 'release_agent' is a script or binary that is specified in the 'release_agent' file of the root cgroup.

Upon the cgroup becoming empty, the 'notify_on_release' mechanism passes the path to the emptied cgroup as an argument to the 'release_agent'. This allows the 'release_agent' to know which cgroup has become empty and needs cleanup.

This mechanism is especially beneficial when it comes to resource management. It helps clean up resources that were allocated to the now-empty cgroup, effectively preventing resource leaks and ensuring the system runs efficiently.

For instance, suppose a cgroup was assigned a certain amount of memory for its tasks. When the tasks are finished and the cgroup becomes empty, without the 'notify_on_release' mechanism, the memory assigned to the cgroup might not be released back to the system, leading to resource wastage.

However, with 'notify_on_release' enabled, the system can automatically initiate cleanup actions, releasing the allocated resources back to the pool. This is just one example of how 'notify_on_release' can help maintain resource efficiency in a Linux system.

To enable 'notify_on_release', you would navigate to the directory of the cgroup you are interested in and echo 1 into the 'notify_on_release' file. For example: `echo 1 /sys/fs/cgroup/my_cgroup/notify_on_release`.

This functionality has been available since the introduction of cgroups in the Linux kernel in 2007. It's primarily a low-level feature, often utilized indirectly through higher-level tools and systems like Docker and Kubernetes, which use cgroups to isolate their workloads.

A detailed real-world example of using `notify_on_release` could involve the management of a cgroup for a specific computational task in a Linux system. Let's say we have a cgroup called `my_cgroup`.

1. **Navigate to the cgroup directory**: The first step is to navigate to the directory of the cgroup we are interested in. In a terminal, we might type:

```bash
cd /sys/fs/cgroup/my_cgroup

```

1. **Enable `notify_on_release`**: We can enable `notify_on_release` by echoing 1 into the `notify_on_release` file. In the terminal, we would type:

```bash
echo 1 notify_on_release

```

This command will set `notify_on_release` to 1, indicating that it is enabled.

1. **Specify a release agent**: We need to specify a release agent that will be called when `my_cgroup` becomes empty. Suppose we have a script called `my_release_agent.sh` that handles resource cleanup, we can specify this as our release agent in the `release_agent` file of the root cgroup.

```bash
echo /path/to/my_release_agent.sh /sys/fs/cgroup/release_agent

```

1. **Run tasks in the cgroup**: Now, we can add tasks to `my_cgroup` and run them. These tasks could be any processes that we want to manage as a group.
2. **Automatic cleanup**: Once all tasks in `my_cgroup` have finished running and it becomes empty, the `notify_on_release` mechanism will trigger. This will call `my_release_agent.sh` with the path to `my_cgroup` as an argument. `my_release_agent.sh` can then perform cleanup operations, such as releasing memory back to the system.

This example illustrates how `notify_on_release` can be used to manage resources effectively in a Linux system, and prevent resource wastage.
