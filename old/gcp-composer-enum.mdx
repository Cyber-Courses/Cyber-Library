# GCP - Composer Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Composer is a fully managed workflow orchestration service that empowers developers to author, schedule, and monitor pipelines that span across clouds and on-premises data centers. The 'Enum' in GCP Composer represents enumeration, a data type consisting of a set of named values called elements, members, enumeral, or enumerators of the type.


### 🧐 Why ?

The GCP Composer Enum is important because it allows developers to define a type of variable that can hold a few predefined values, typically a list of variants for a given data type. This can significantly simplify the management of data flows and tasks, helping organizations streamline their workflows, reduce errors, and improve overall efficiency. It is crucial for readers who work with data processing and management in cloud environments, especially those using GCP.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use GCP Composer Enum, you first need to create a Composer environment in the GCP console. Then, in your Python DAG file, you can use the Enum module to create enumerations, which are iterable, hashable, and support symbolic equality comparison. For example, you can define 'DaysOfWeek' as an enumeration of all seven days, and then use it in your tasks or operators as DaysOfWeek.MONDAY, DaysOfWeek.TUESDAY, etc.


### ⏳ When ?

GCP Composer was first introduced in 2018 as part of Google's commitment to open source, and it's been an essential tool for developers working with GCP ever since. The use of Enums in programming dates back to the early days of computing, but its implementation in GCP Composer has expanded its usage and made it more powerful and versatile in cloud workflows.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a deeper level, GCP Composer is built on Apache Airflow, an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. The Enum in GCP Composer is a Python Enum, which is a data type that contains a fixed set of constant values. Enums can be used to create a collection of related constants that can be associated with a type. In the context of GCP Composer, Enums are often used to define sets of constants for things like days of the week, states of a task, or types of operators. These predefined constants can then be used within the DAGs to control the flow of tasks, making the code cleaner, easier to read, and less prone to errors.
