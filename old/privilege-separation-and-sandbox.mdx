# Privilege Separation and Sandbox


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Privilege Separation and Sandbox are two fundamental concepts in the field of cybersecurity. Privilege Separation is a method of minimizing the potential damage that could result from a security breach by ensuring that a process doesn't have more privileges than it needs. On the other hand, a Sandbox is a security mechanism used to isolate running programs, preventing malicious or malfunctioning programs from damaging or snooping on the rest of the system.


### üßê¬†Why ?

The importance of Privilege Separation and Sandbox lies in their role in minimizing the risks and potential damages of cyber attacks. By limiting the privileges of a process, the scope of a potential security breach is also limited. Similarly, by isolating running programs in a sandbox, the security of the rest of the system is maintained, even if a program proves to be malicious or malfunctioning. These concepts are therefore crucial for anyone interested in cybersecurity, whether for personal use or in a professional context.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To implement Privilege Separation, you would need to carefully analyze your processes and determine the minimum set of privileges each one needs. Then, you can use a variety of methods, such as user account control, to ensure that each process only has access to the privileges it needs. For Sandbox, there are several software and tools available that can create isolated environments for running programs. You would need to install one of these tools, and then run any new or untrusted programs within the sandbox.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The concepts of Privilege Separation and Sandbox have been used in the field of cybersecurity for several years. Their use has become more widespread with the increase in cyber threats and the growing recognition of the importance of cybersecurity.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Privilege Separation and Sandbox are both important concepts in cybersecurity, often used to limit the potential damage of cyber attacks.

Privilege Separation is a technique where a program is divided into parts which are limited to the specific privileges they require. This way, an attack is only able to exploit the privileges of a single part of a program, instead of exploiting the entire program. To implement this, processes are analyzed to determine the minimum set of privileges they require to function. Then, each process is assigned a unique user ID at the operating system level, which determines what privileges it has access to. This ensures that even if a process is compromised, the potential damage is limited to what that particular process can do, preventing the attacker from gaining complete control over the system.

Sandboxing, on the other hand, is a security mechanism used to run an application in a restricted environment, or 'sandbox', to prevent it from affecting other parts of the system. It creates an isolated operating environment within a computer system, which imitates the features of a regular operating system but remains detached from the rest of the system. This means that a program running in a sandbox cannot interact with other parts of the system, protecting the system from potential threats. Any changes made by the program are confined to the sandbox and do not affect the system outside it. To implement a sandbox, various software and tools are available that can create these isolated environments.

Both of these techniques have been used for several years in the field of cybersecurity, and their use has only grown with the rise in cyber threats. By understanding and implementing these concepts, it's possible to significantly enhance the security of a computer system.

Here are detailed real-life examples of both Privilege Separation and Sandbox:

1. **Privilege Separation**: Suppose you are developing a web application that connects to a database. You can implement privilege separation by assigning different roles to different parts of your application. For example, the part of your application that only needs to read data from the database should not have the privilege to write data. This can be achieved by setting up specific user accounts on your database management system (DBMS) with read-only permissions.

```sql
-- Creating a new user with read-only access in SQL
CREATE USER 'readonly'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT ON database.* TO 'readonly'@'localhost';

```

In the above SQL commands, a new user 'readonly' is created with a password 'password'. Then, the SELECT privilege is granted to this user which means this user can only read data from the database, not write or modify it. So, even if an attacker compromises this part of the application, they can't write malicious data into the database.

1. **Sandboxing**: Suppose you download a new software application but you're not sure if it's safe. You can run it in a sandbox to ensure that if it's malicious, it won't be able to harm your system. A popular sandboxing tool is Sandboxie for Windows.

```bash
# Running a program in Sandboxie
Start.exe /box:BoxName program.exe

```

In this command, `Start.exe` is the Sandboxie command-line tool, `BoxName` is the name of the sandbox you've created, and `program.exe` is the executable file you want to run. This command will run the program in the specified sandbox, isolating it from the rest of your system. So, even if the program attempts to make malicious changes, these will be confined to the sandbox and won't affect your system.
