# Deserialization


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Deserialization is the process of converting a stream of bytes back into a copy of the original object. These bytes typically have been written to a file or sent over a network by a corresponding serialization process. It's a fundamental concept in programming languages such as Java and Python, among others, especially when dealing with data storage and transmission.


### 🧐 Why ?

Deserialization is important because it allows data structures or objects to be restored to their original state after transmission or storage. This process is crucial in many applications, such as distributed systems or web applications, where objects need to be transmitted over a network or stored for later use. Understanding deserialization can help developers design more efficient applications and also avoid potential security vulnerabilities.


### ⛏️ How ?

To utilize deserialization, one must first serialize an object, which involves converting the object into a format (typically a byte stream) that can be stored or transmitted. Once the serialized data reaches its destination or is retrieved from storage, it can then be deserialized back into its original form. In Java, for example, you might use the ObjectOutputStream to serialize an object and the ObjectInputStream to deserialize it. However, one must be cautious as insecure deserialization can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.


### ⏳ When ?

Deserialization is used whenever an object needs to be transmitted over a network or stored for later use. It has been a fundamental concept in programming since the advent of network computing and persists in modern applications, including cloud computing and distributed systems.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

At its core, deserialization is about reversing the process of serialization. Serialization transforms an object's state to a byte stream, allowing it to be stored or transmitted. Deserialization, then, involves reading this byte stream and recreating the original object from it. This is done by using the class description and data sent in the serialized object. However, deserialization can lead to vulnerabilities if not handled securely. If an attacker can supply a malicious serialized object, they could potentially run arbitrary code when the object is deserialized. As such, it's crucial to ensure serialized data is both securely transmitted and trustworthy before deserialization.
