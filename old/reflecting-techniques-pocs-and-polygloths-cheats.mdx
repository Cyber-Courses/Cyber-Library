# Reflecting Techniques - PoCs and Polygloths CheatSheet


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Reflecting techniques are methods used in cybersecurity to manipulate system behaviour, often to disguise or redirect data flow. This CheatSheet provides a detailed overview of PoCs (Proofs of Concept) and Polygloths, two key elements of reflecting techniques.


### 🧐 Why ?

Reflecting techniques, including PoCs and Polygloths, are critical in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity. They are used by attackers to obfuscate their actions and bypass security measures. Understanding these techniques is crucial for creating robust security systems and for identifying potential vulnerabilities.


### ⛏️ How ?

To implement reflecting techniques, one must first understand the system behaviour. With this knowledge, they can manipulate data flow, often through coding methods. PoCs are used to demonstrate how a system can be compromised, often highlighting specific vulnerabilities. Polygloths, on the other hand, are programs or scripts that can be executed in multiple programming languages, often used to trick security systems or to increase the versatility of an attack.


### ⏳ When ?

Reflecting techniques have been in use for several years in the field of cybersecurity. Their use has grown with the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks and the need for more advanced and adaptive security measures.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Reflecting techniques involve the manipulation of system behaviour, often through coding methods. PoCs demonstrate how a system can be compromised, highlighting specific vulnerabilities. They are often used by security researchers to demonstrate potential threats and to validate the effectiveness of security measures. Polygloths are programs or scripts that can be executed in multiple programming languages. They can be used to trick security systems into misidentifying malicious code or to increase the versatility and adaptability of an attack. Understanding these techniques is crucial for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity.
