# FreeIPA Pentesting


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> FreeIPA Pentesting refers to the practice of evaluating the security of the FreeIPA (Identity, Policy, and Audit) system. It is an open-source project sponsored by Red Hat, providing a solution for managing identities and policies in Linux/Unix environments.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Pentesting FreeIPA is crucial as it helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities and security loopholes in the FreeIPA system. This process is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of user data, enforcing policy adherence, and preventing unauthorized access.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To implement FreeIPA pentesting, start by setting up a controlled environment with a FreeIPA system. Use tools like NMAP for network scanning, Metasploit for vulnerability exploitation, and Wireshark for traffic analysis. Always remember to document your findings for further mitigation and remediation processes.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The practice of FreeIPA pentesting began gaining traction with the increase in Linux/Unix based environments and the need for a secure identity management system.

### Detailed Guide to Penetration Testing on a FreeIPA System

### Overview

FreeIPA is an open-source identity management system that integrates several key services such as LDAP, DNS, and Kerberos. Conducting penetration testing on a FreeIPA system involves various stages, including network scanning, enumeration, vulnerability exploitation, and thorough documentation of findings. Below is a detailed guide on how to perform these tasks.

### Step-by-Step Penetration Testing Process

### 1. Network Scanning with NMAP

**Objective**: Identify open ports and services running on the FreeIPA server.

**Tool**: NMAP

**Command**:

```bash
nmap -sV -p- target_IP_address

```

**Explanation**:

- `sV`: Service version detection
- `p-`: Scan all ports
- `target_IP_address`: IP address of the FreeIPA server

**Example Output**:

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
389/tcp   open  ldap    OpenLDAP 2.4.45
53/tcp    open  domain  ISC BIND 9.11.3-1ubuntu1.13 (Ubuntu Linux)
88/tcp    open  kerberos-sec
464/tcp   open  kpasswd

```

### 2. Enumeration

**Objective**: Extract detailed information about the FreeIPA server, such as user names and network resources.

**Tool**: ldapsearch (for LDAP enumeration)

**Command**:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://target_IP_address -b "dc=example,dc=com"

```

**Explanation**:

- `x`: Simple authentication
- `H ldap://target_IP_address`: LDAP server address
- `b "dc=example,dc=com"`: Base DN for the search

**Example Output**:

```
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <dc=example,dc=com> with scope subtree
# filter: (objectclass=*)
# requesting: ALL
#

# example.com
dn: dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: dcObject
objectClass: organization
o: Example Organization
dc: example

# admin, example.com
dn: uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com
uid: admin
cn: Admin User
sn: User
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: shadowAccount
loginShell: /bin/bash
uidNumber: 1000
gidNumber: 1000
homeDirectory: /home/admin

```

### 3. Vulnerability Exploitation

**Objective**: Exploit identified vulnerabilities to emulate unauthorized access or attacks.

**Tool**: Metasploit Framework

**Example**:
Suppose the LDAP service is running an outdated version with known vulnerabilities. Here's how you might exploit it using Metasploit:

**Steps**:

1. **Launch Metasploit**:
    
    ```bash
    msfconsole
    
    ```
    
2. **Search for Exploits**:
    
    ```bash
    search ldap
    
    ```
    
3. **Select an Exploit**:
    
    ```bash
    use exploit/linux/ldap/...
    
    ```
    
4. **Set the Target**:
    
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS target_IP_address
    set RPORT 389
    
    ```
    
5. **Run the Exploit**:
    
    ```bash
    run
    
    ```
    

**Example Metasploit Commands**:

```bash
msf6 > search ldap

[*] 192.168.1.100:389  - 192.168.1.100:389 LDAP server version: OpenLDAP 2.4.45
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed

```

### 4. Documentation
