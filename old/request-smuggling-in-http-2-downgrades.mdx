# Request Smuggling in HTTP/2 Downgrades


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> HTTP/2 Downgrade Attacks, also known as Request Smuggling, is a type of cyber attack where an attacker manipulates HTTP/2 connections to degrade them to HTTP/1, then smuggles malicious requests into legitimate HTTP/2 traffic. This can lead to various security issues such as cache poisoning, session hijacking, and bypassing security controls.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding HTTP/2 Downgrade Attacks is crucial because it exposes the vulnerabilities in the HTTP/2 protocol, which is widely used for web communication. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to smuggle malicious requests, compromise user data, and bypass security measures. Therefore, being aware of such threats can help in improving the security of web applications and services.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To prevent HTTP/2 Downgrade Attacks, it is important to secure the HTTP/2 protocol. This includes validating all input data, enforcing strict security policies, and regularly updating and patching the system. Additionally, using a web application firewall (WAF) can help detect and block HTTP smuggling attempts.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> HTTP/2 Downgrade Attacks started to surface with the widespread adoption of the HTTP/2 protocol in recent years. As more web applications and services switched to HTTP/2 for better performance and efficiency, attackers started exploiting the vulnerabilities in the protocol for malicious purposes.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

In an HTTP/2 Downgrade Attack, an attacker manipulates the 'Upgrade' or 'Connection' header fields in an HTTP/1.1 request to trick the server into downgrading the connection to HTTP/1.1. The attacker then smuggles malicious requests into the legitimate HTTP/2 traffic. These smuggled requests can bypass security controls, compromise user data, and even take control of the server. To prevent such attacks, it is crucial to properly validate all input data and enforce strict security policies. Regular updates and patching of the system, as well as the use of a WAF, can also help in detecting and blocking HTTP smuggling attempts.
