### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use GCP Storage Enum, start by creating a bucket in the Google Cloud Console. This is your top-level container that will hold your data objects. Next, upload your data objects to the bucket. You can do this either through the Cloud Console, gsutil (a Python application that lets you access Cloud Storage from the command line), or the Cloud Storage Client Libraries. Once your data is in your bucket, you can then share, download, and manage your data using the same tools.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

GCP Storage Enum operates on the principle of 'objects' stored in 'buckets'. An object is an individual piece of data stored in Cloud Storage. Each object includes the data itself, metadata, and an ID. A bucket, on the other hand, is a container for objects. It organizes objects into a hierarchical structure, similar to the directory structure of a file system. GCP Storage Enum uses a RESTful API, which means you can access your data over HTTP using standard HTTP methods. It also provides strong consistency, ensuring that once a write operation is completed, the latest copy of an object is returned to all GET requests.
