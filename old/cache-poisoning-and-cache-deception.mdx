# Cache Poisoning and Cache Deception


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Cache Poisoning and Cache Deception are two types of cyber attacks that target the cache data of a system. Cache, a component that stores data so future requests for that data can be served faster, is a crucial part of many systems, including web servers and browsers. Cache Poisoning involves manipulating the data in the cache, causing the system to serve inaccurate or malicious content. Cache Deception, on the other hand, involves tricking the system into caching sensitive information, which can then be accessed by the attacker.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding these concepts is crucial because they highlight the vulnerabilities in cache mechanisms, which are widespread in Information Technology systems. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to serious breaches, exposing sensitive data or spreading malicious content. For organizations, such breaches can result in significant financial and reputational damage.


### ⛏️ How ?

To protect against Cache Poisoning and Cache Deception, several measures can be taken. First, regularly flushing the cache can remove any manipulated or wrongfully cached data. Second, implementing security measures such as encryption and authentication can prevent unauthorized access to the cache. Third, configuring the system to prevent caching of sensitive information can guard against Cache Deception.


### ⏳ When ?

Cache Poisoning and Cache Deception attacks have been known since the early days of the internet, but they have become more prevalent with the increasing reliance on caching mechanisms for improving system performance.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, Cache Poisoning usually involves sending false responses to a system's cache requests, causing it to store and serve inaccurate data. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system's cache management or by manipulating network traffic. Cache Deception, meanwhile, involves tricking the system into treating sensitive information as cacheable, often by manipulating the system's cache-control headers. Once the sensitive information is cached, it can be accessed by sending a request that the cache will respond to.
