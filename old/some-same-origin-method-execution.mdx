# SOME - Same Origin Method Execution


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Same Origin Method Execution (SOME) is a security concept that restricts web content interaction to only those within the same origin. The origin is defined by the scheme (http or https), host name, and port number. This means that a script from one page cannot access or modify the properties of a page from a different origin.


### 🧐 Why ?

SOME is crucial in web security as it prevents malicious scripts on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another page through that page's DOM (Document Object Model). Without SOME, a malicious script could potentially read sensitive information from another site, or invoke actions on that site, acting as the user.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use SOME effectively, it is important to have a strong understanding of the concept of same-origin policy and how it affects the interaction of web content. Developers should ensure that their web applications strictly follow this policy to prevent cross-site scripting attacks and cross-site request forgery. This can be achieved by properly validating and sanitising all user inputs and employing strong session management.


### ⏳ When ?

The concept of Same Origin Method Execution has been in use since the early days of web development, as a fundamental part of web security. It has become even more important with the increasing complexity and interactivity of modern web applications.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

In the context of web security, an 'origin' is defined by the scheme, host, and port of a URL. For instance, the origin of 'http://example.com:80' is different from 'https://example.com:443'. The Same Origin Method Execution (SOME) policy restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin. It is a critical aspect of web security as it prevents malicious scripts from accessing sensitive data in a manner that the user didn't intend. Violations of SOME often lead to serious security breaches, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). To properly implement SOME, it's crucial for developers to understand how the browser defines 'same-origin' and to ensure that their applications strictly adhere to this policy.
