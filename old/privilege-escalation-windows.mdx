# Privilege Escalation - Windows


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Privilege Escalation is the process of gaining higher-level permissions on a system, starting from a lower-level permission. In the context of Windows, this often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or misconfigurations to gain higher-level privileges such as Administrator or SYSTEM.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Privilege Escalation is important because it allows an attacker to gain more control over a system, potentially leading to data loss, system damage, or unauthorized access to sensitive data. Understanding how Privilege Escalation works can help in securing Windows systems and mitigating potential threats.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

Privilege Escalation can be achieved in multiple ways, such as exploiting software vulnerabilities, leveraging misconfigurations, or using social engineering techniques. A typical approach involves first gaining low-level access to a system, then escalating privileges by exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration. This process can be complex and requires a detailed understanding of the Windows operating system.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Privilege Escalation has been a common attack vector ever since the inception of multi-user computer systems, and it continues to be a major threat in the modern era of cybersecurity.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Privilege Escalation in Windows typically involves taking advantage of the Windows security model, which is built on the foundation of user accounts and their respective access rights. This process primarily involves an attacker, initially having low-level privileges, exploiting certain aspects of the system to gain higher-level permissions.

There are two distinct forms of privilege escalation: vertical and horizontal. Vertical privilege escalation, also known as escalating privileges, entails moving from a lower-level privilege to a higher one. For example, an attacker might exploit a software vulnerability to execute code with administrator privileges.

On the other hand, horizontal privilege escalation involves an attacker with a certain level of privileges exploiting the system to access resources that should be inaccessible to them at their current privilege level. For instance, an attacker might manipulate the system's permissions through misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to resources.

Conducting these types of attacks requires an in-depth understanding of the Windows security model, including the roles and permissions associated with different user accounts. Additionally, attackers need to be familiar with common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that they can exploit to escalate their privileges.

Defending against privilege escalation attacks also demands a thorough understanding of the Windows security model. System administrators need to ensure that all software is up-to-date and that security patches are applied promptly to minimize vulnerabilities. They should also follow the principle of least privilege, assigning users the minimum permissions they need to perform their tasks. Regular audits of user permissions and system configurations can help identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited in a privilege escalation attack.
