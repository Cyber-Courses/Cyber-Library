# Detach from the process.


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Detaching from the process is a conscious decision to step back and observe the situation or problem from a different perspective. This method allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the problem at hand, by breaking it down into its most basic parts. It's often used in conjunction with first-principle thinking, a problem-solving method used by the likes of Elon Musk and Aristotle, that involves questioning every assumption about the problem until you are left with the fundamental truths.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Detaching from the process is critical in problem-solving because it promotes clear thinking by eliminating bias and preconceived notions. It allows us to think more critically and creatively, leading to more innovative solutions. Furthermore, it's an essential skill for anyone looking to improve their critical thinking or problem-solving abilities.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To effectively detach from a process, start by defining the problem clearly. Next, break it down into its fundamental components by asking 'why' or 'how' at each stage, removing any assumptions or biases. Then, observe the process objectively, as if you were an outsider with no prior knowledge of the situation. Finally, use your observations to come up with innovative solutions that you may not have considered previously.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The concept of detaching from the process has long been used in various fields such as philosophy, psychology, and business. However, it's gained more prominence in recent years due to the rise of first-principle thinking, popularized by figures like Elon Musk.

### Overview

Detaching from the process is a cognitive strategy designed to enhance problem-solving and critical thinking by removing oneself from immediate subjective experiences. This approach encourages viewing situations or problems objectively, free from personal biases and preconceived notions, thereby gaining clearer, unbiased insights.

### Steps in the Detaching from the Process Strategy

### 1. Clearly Define the Problem

The initial step involves precisely identifying and defining the problem. This requires:

- **Asking Probing Questions**: Delve deeper by asking questions that uncover more details about the issue.
- **Challenging Assumptions**: Question existing beliefs and assumptions to reveal underlying truths.
- **Understanding Root Causes**: Focus on the fundamental causes of the problem rather than just addressing the symptoms.

### 2. First-Principle Thinking

Next, break down the problem into its most fundamental parts, known as first-principle thinking:

- **Questioning Assumptions**: Continuously ask why each aspect of the problem exists until reaching the core truths.
- **Identifying Fundamental Truths**: Strip away all assumptions and beliefs to understand the basic elements of the problem.
- **Encouraging Innovation**: By understanding the problem at its core, this method allows for radical innovation rather than incremental improvements.

### 3. Removing Bias and Preconceptions

With the problem broken down, it‚Äôs crucial to remove biases and preconceptions:

- **Setting Aside Personal Views**: Acknowledge and set aside personal biases and preferences.
- **Open-Mindedness**: Be willing to consider solutions and perspectives that differ from personal beliefs.

### 4. Observing the Process Objectively

Finally, observe the problem or process as if you were an outsider:

- **Adopt an External Perspective**: View the situation without any prior knowledge or involvement.
- **Gaining Fresh Insights**: This external viewpoint can offer new, valuable perspectives that might not be evident from a subjective standpoint.

### Real-World Example: Improving a Mobile Application‚Äôs User Interface (UI)

### 1. Defining the Problem

The product manager notices a drop in user engagement but is unsure of the cause:

- **Asking Questions**: "Which features have decreased usage?" "Is the decline consistent across all user demographics?"
- **Analyzing Data**: Gather and analyze data on user behavior and engagement metrics.

### 2. First-Principle Thinking

The product manager digs deeper:

- **Questioning Assumptions**: "Is the issue truly with the UI, or could it be due to app performance or external factors like market competition?"
- **Identifying User Needs**: Understand the fundamental needs and behaviors of users.

### 3. Breaking Down the Problem

The manager identifies a key issue:

- **Confusing Navigation Menu**: Realizes that users find the current navigation confusing, leading to decreased engagement.
- **Fundamental Issue**: Simplifying the navigation could address the root cause of the engagement drop.

### 4. Removing Bias and Preconceptions

The product manager sets aside personal attachment to the current design:

- **Open to Change**: Even if the current design is favored by the team, be open to the idea that it may not work for users.

### 5. Observing the Process Objectively

The manager conducts user testing sessions:

- **User Testing**: Observe how users interact with the app without interference or defense of the design.
- **Objective Notes**: Take notes on areas where users struggle or ask questions, focusing on user behavior and feedback.

### Conclusion

Detaching from the process is a valuable cognitive strategy for problem-solving and critical thinking. By clearly defining the problem, employing first-principle thinking, removing biases, and observing objectively, one can gain deep insights and develop innovative solutions. This approach is essential for making informed, unbiased decisions that can lead to significant improvements and breakthroughs.
