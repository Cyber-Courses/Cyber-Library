# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Dblink is a PostgreSQL module that allows connections to other PostgreSQL databases from within a database. It can perform queries on these external databases and return the results. The lo_import function is used to import a file from the server's file system into a large object in the database. An attacker could potentially use these functions to exfiltrate data by creating a connection to a remote database under their control and transferring data to it.
