# LFI2RCE Via temp file uploads


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

LFI2RCE Via temp file uploads is a technique used by attackers to exploit an existing Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability and convert it into a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. This is achieved by uploading a malicious PHP script to a temporary file in the server and then using the LFI vulnerability to execute the malicious script.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding LFI2RCE Via temp file uploads is crucial for both penetration testers and system administrators. For penetration testers, it is a powerful technique to escalate privileges and gain complete control over a vulnerable system. For system administrators, it is essential to understand this technique in order to effectively secure their servers and protect them from such attacks.


### ⛏️ How ?

To exploit LFI2RCE Via temp file uploads, an attacker first needs to find an LFI vulnerability in the web application. Once found, the attacker uploads a malicious script (usually a PHP script) to a temporary file in the server. The attacker then uses the LFI vulnerability to include the temporary file, which results in the execution of the malicious script. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability, which can be used to take over the server.


### ⏳ When ?

LFI2RCE Via temp file uploads has been a known attack technique for quite some time. However, it has gained popularity in recent years due to the increasing number of web applications with LFI vulnerabilities.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, LFI2RCE Via temp file uploads involves taking advantage of the way PHP handles file inclusions. PHP allows a script to include another file as if it were part of the same script. This is useful for reusing code, but it can be exploited if an attacker can control which file is included. This is where the LFI vulnerability comes in. If an attacker can upload a file to the server (in this case, a malicious PHP script), and then manipulate the web application to include that file, they can get their code to run on the server. The use of temporary files is just a way to ensure that the malicious file exists on the server long enough to be included and executed.
