# Docker Breakout / Privilege Escalation


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Linux Docker Breakout or Privilege Escalation is a cybersecurity issue where a user or process within a Docker container gains unauthorized access to the host machine or other containers. Docker, an open-source platform, is used to automate the deployment, scaling, and isolation of applications using containerization. The fundamental concept underlying this issue is the principle of least privilege, which stipulates that a user or process should only have the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Understanding Linux Docker Breakout/Privilege Escalation is crucial because Docker's growing popularity makes it a potential target for cyber attacks. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could gain control over the host system, thereby compromising the security and integrity of all applications running within the containers. Thus, cybersecurity professionals should have a proper understanding of this issue to adequately secure Dockerized environments.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To mitigate the risk of a Docker Breakout, follow these steps: 1) Ensure to use the latest version of Docker, as older versions might have known vulnerabilities. 2) Limit the permissions of the Docker daemon and follow the principle of least privilege. 3) Regularly monitor and audit Docker containers for any suspicious activity. 4) Implement strong user authentication and access control measures. 5) Use Docker security tools like Docker Bench for Security or Clair for vulnerability scanning.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

The practice of containerization has been in use since the early days of Linux. However, Docker, launched in 2013, popularized it due to its ease of use and efficiency. As its usage grew, so did the potential security issues associated with it, including the risk of Docker Breakouts, which have come to the forefront in recent years.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Docker is a popular open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and isolation of applications using containerization. Each application running in a Docker container has its own environment, which is isolated from other containers and the host system. This isolation is achieved using a Linux feature called 'namespaces'. Each container runs in its own namespace and is unaware of the existence of other containers or processes on the host system.

However, this isolation can be breached in a scenario known as a Docker Breakout. A Docker Breakout occurs when a process within a container manages to escape its namespace and gains access to the host system or other containers. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or even control over the host system, which is a significant security concern.

Privilege escalation is a related issue where a process within a container acquires more privileges than it was originally granted. If a process escapes its container and then escalates its privileges, it can cause substantial damage, including unauthorized access, data alteration or deletion, and system disruptions.

Preventing Docker Breakouts and privilege escalation requires a comprehensive security strategy:

- **Patch Management**: Regularly update Docker to the latest version. Older versions may have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited for a Docker Breakout.
- **Access Control**: Implement strict user authentication and access control measures to prevent unauthorized access. The principle of least privilege should be applied, where a user or process only has the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitor Docker containers for any unusual or suspicious activity. This can include logging system events, network traffic, and user behavior.
- **Security Tools**: Use Docker security tools like Docker Bench for Security or Clair for vulnerability scanning. These tools can help identify potential vulnerabilities and guide you in implementing security best practices.

Understanding Docker's architecture, keeping up with its latest security updates, and implementing a robust security strategy are essential steps in mitigating the risk of Docker Breakouts and privilege escalation.

Here's a simplified example of how a Docker Breakout and Privilege Escalation could occur, and measures to prevent such an event:

1. A user starts a Docker container with an application running:

```bash
docker run -d my_application

```

1. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application and gains unauthorized access to the container's shell:

```bash
docker exec -it [container_id] /bin/bash

```

1. The attacker then launches a privilege escalation attack, for example, by exploiting a vulnerability in the Linux kernel running inside the container and becomes the root user:

```bash
/bin/bash -p

```

1. With root access, the attacker can now perform a Docker Breakout, escaping the container and gaining access to the host system. For example, they might manipulate the container's namespace settings to gain access to the host's filesystem:

```bash
mount -o bind /host_path /container_path

```

1. Now, the attacker has access to the host system and could potentially cause significant damage, such as stealing sensitive data, disrupting system operations, and more.

To prevent such a situation:

- **Patch Management**: Always update Docker to the latest version to minimize the risk of known vulnerabilities. Run `docker version` to check your Docker version, and `apt-get install docker-ce` (on Ubuntu) to update Docker.
- **Access Control**: Restrict Docker's permissions by running containers as a non-root user whenever possible. This can be done using the `u` flag in the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -d -u [non-root user] my_application

```

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Use Docker's logging capabilities to monitor container activity:

```bash
docker logs [container_id]

```

- **Security Tools**: Employ Docker security tools like Docker Bench for Security or Clair. Docker Bench can be run as a Docker container itself, and it will give you a report on potential security issues:

```bash
docker run -it --net host --pid host --userns host --cap-add audit_control \\
    -e DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=$DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST \\
    -v /var/lib:/var/lib \\
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\
    -v /usr/lib/systemd:/usr/lib/systemd \\
    -v /etc:/etc --label docker_bench_security \\
    docker/docker-bench-security

```
