# Steal Info JS


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Steal Info JS is a malicious JavaScript code snippet that is used to exploit web vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information from a victim's browser.


### 🧐 Why ?

Steal Info JS is important because it poses a significant threat to web security. It's capable of stealing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and other personal data. As such, understanding it is crucial for both developers and cybersecurity professionals to protect websites and web applications from this type of attack.


### ⛏️ How ?

One can use Steal Info JS to their advantage by understanding how it works and implementing appropriate countermeasures. These include using secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities that this malicious code can exploit, implementing input validation to filter out potentially harmful data, and keeping software and systems updated to patch any known vulnerabilities.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of Steal Info JS started to become prevalent with the rise of dynamic web applications which heavily rely on JavaScript. Its usage has been growing due to the increasing number of web applications and the complexity of their JavaScript code.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Steal Info JS works by exploiting weaknesses in web applications, particularly those that do not properly validate user input or sanitize output. This allows the malicious code to be injected into the webpage and executed by the victim's browser. The stolen information is then sent back to the attacker's server. To defend against such attacks, developers should employ secure coding practices such as input validation, output encoding, and use of appropriate security headers. Security professionals can also employ intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect and block such attacks.
