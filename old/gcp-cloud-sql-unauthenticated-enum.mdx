# GCP - Cloud SQL Unauthenticated Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Cloud SQL Unauthenticated Enumeration is a process of identifying and gathering information about databases without needing authentication. This vulnerability can potentially expose sensitive data stored in the databases.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP - Cloud SQL Unauthenticated Enumeration is crucial as it poses a significant security risk. If exploited, it can lead to data breaches, loss of sensitive information, and unauthorized access to the databases. Knowledge about this vulnerability will help in implementing appropriate security measures and prevent potential cyber attacks.


### ⛏️ How ?

GCP - Cloud SQL Unauthenticated Enumeration can be mitigated by implementing proper access controls, regular monitoring, and auditing of the databases. It is also recommended to restrict public access to the databases and enable the 'Private IP' option in the Cloud SQL instance settings. Additionally, using security tools to detect any suspicious activities can help in preventing data breaches.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of GCP - Cloud SQL Unauthenticated Enumeration began when organizations started migrating their databases to the cloud. As cloud databases became more popular, so did the methods to exploit their vulnerabilities.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP - Cloud SQL Unauthenticated Enumeration involves the process of interacting with the Cloud SQL API to retrieve a list of databases without needing any form of authentication. This is a serious vulnerability as it can expose sensitive information such as database names, IP addresses, and even running services. From a technical perspective, this occurs due to improper access controls and security configurations. The Enumeration process involves sending HTTP requests to the API and retrieving the responses. By analyzing these responses, an attacker can gather valuable information about the underlying databases.
