# GCP - Run Privesc


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Run Privesc is a cybersecurity concept that allows users to escalate their privileges on Google Cloud Run instances. This is a potential security vulnerability as it can allow unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive data and control over the system.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP Run Privesc is crucial for anyone working with Google Cloud Platform. It helps in identifying and mitigating potential security threats to your cloud infrastructure. Ignoring such vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches, loss of sensitive information, and potential damage to your organization's reputation.


### ⛏️ How ?

To implement GCP Run Privesc, one must first have access to a Google Cloud Run instance. Once inside, exploitation is typically done through a series of commands that exploit the system's vulnerabilities and escalate the user's privileges. To protect against this, it's important to regularly update and patch your system, limit the privileges of cloud users, and continuously monitor for any suspicious activity.


### ⏳ When ?

The concept of GCP Run Privesc came into existence with the advent of cloud computing. It has become increasingly relevant with the growing number of businesses migrating their operations to the cloud.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, GCP Run Privesc works by exploiting the inherent vulnerabilities of Google Cloud Run instances. These instances are essentially containers that run your applications and are isolated from each other for security reasons. However, with the right knowledge and tools, a user can break out of this isolation and gain unauthorized access to other instances. This is known as a 'privilege escalation' attack. The attacker can then execute commands within the compromised instance, gaining control over the system and access to sensitive data. To mitigate this threat, it's important to implement robust security practices such as regular patching, limiting user privileges, and continuous monitoring.
