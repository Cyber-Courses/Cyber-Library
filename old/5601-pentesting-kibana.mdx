# 5601 - Pentesting Kibana


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Pentesting Kibana refers to the process of conducting a penetration testing on Kibana, a popular open-source data visualization and exploration tool used for log and time-series analytics, application monitoring, and operational intelligence use cases. It is part of the Elastic Stack (formerly known as the ELK Stack), which includes Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.


### 🧐 Why ?

With the prevalence of cyber threats, pentesting Kibana is crucial to uncover potential vulnerabilities and ensure the security of your data. As Kibana is widely used for data visualization and monitoring, a breach could lead to significant data loss or unauthorized data access. Thus, understanding how to pentest Kibana allows you to identify, fix, and prevent security vulnerabilities, contributing to a more robust and secure IT environment.


### ⛏️ How ?

Pentesting Kibana involves several steps. First, you need to understand the Kibana architecture and its underlying Elasticsearch database. Then, you can proceed with vulnerability scanning using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS. Next, you should analyze the results and prioritize the vulnerabilities based on their severity and impact. After that, you can exploit these vulnerabilities using penetration testing tools or techniques. Lastly, you should document your findings and provide recommendations for remediation.


### ⏳ When ?

Pentesting Kibana, like any other system, should be conducted regularly, especially when changes are made to the system. It is also recommended to perform pentesting after installing Kibana for the first time to ensure that there are no vulnerabilities in the initial setup. Additionally, pentesting should be part of a proactive, ongoing cybersecurity strategy, rather than a one-time event.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Pentesting Kibana is an intricate process that necessitates an in-depth comprehension of the Elastic Stack and cybersecurity practices.

Kibana, an integral part of the Elastic Stack, is supported by Elasticsearch, a powerful search and analytics engine. Elasticsearch stores data in a structured format, enabling Kibana to retrieve this data and present it in a visual, user-friendly manner. This interaction between Kibana and Elasticsearch could potentially expose vulnerabilities, especially if there are misconfigurations or if security features have not been correctly implemented.

For example, if Elasticsearch isn't adequately secured, an attacker could exploit this loophole by executing arbitrary queries or modifying data. This could potentially compromise the integrity of the information stored in the database and lead to unauthorized data access or data loss.

Similarly, Kibana may have vulnerabilities that allow for various forms of cyber-attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) or remote code execution. Cross-site scripting is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Remote code execution, on the other hand, allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's system, potentially giving them full control over the system.

The primary objective of pentesting Kibana is to uncover such vulnerabilities and assess the system's resilience against cyber-attacks. This involves a series of steps, starting with a comprehensive understanding of Kibana's architecture and its underlying Elasticsearch database.

Next, vulnerability scanning is carried out using specialized tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to identify potential weaknesses. Once identified, these vulnerabilities are analyzed, and their severity and potential impact are assessed.

The following step involves exploiting these vulnerabilities using various penetration testing tools or techniques to evaluate their real-world impact. This could involve attempting to execute an XSS attack or trying to run arbitrary code.

Finally, the findings from the pentest are documented, detailing each vulnerability, the potential impact, and recommendations for remediation. This report serves as a roadmap for enhancing the security posture of Kibana and the overall IT environment.

Here is a simplified, educational use case of pentesting Kibana:

1. **Understanding the system**: The first step is to understand the Kibana-Elasticsearch configuration. This involves understanding the data indexing, the Elastic API, the setup of the Kibana dashboards, etc.
2. **Vulnerability scanning**: The next step is to perform the vulnerability scanning. A tool like Nessus can be used to scan the target. Here is an example of a command to launch a scan:

```
nessuscli scan new -T "Kibana Pentest" -r "192.0.2.0/24" -p 5601

```

In this command, `Kibana Pentest` is the name of the new scan, `192.0.2.0/24` is the IP range of the target, and `5601` is the default Kibana port.

1. **Vulnerability assessment**: Once the scan is complete, the vulnerabilities are analyzed. For instance, if the scan reveals a misconfiguration that allows unrestricted access to Elasticsearch, this vulnerability is noted.
2. **Exploitation**: After assessing the vulnerabilities, the next step is to try to exploit them. For example, if the scan showed an XSS vulnerability in Kibana, a penetration tester might attempt to exploit this by injecting a malicious script into the search bar:

```html
<scriptalert('XSS')</script

```

If an alert box appears with the message `XSS`, this confirms the vulnerability.

1. **Documentation**: Finally, each vulnerability, its potential impact, and the steps taken to exploit it are documented. For example:

```
- Vulnerability: Unrestricted access to Elasticsearch
- Impact: Potential data loss or unauthorized data access
- Exploitation: Successful execution of arbitrary queries
- Remediation: Implement proper access controls

```

This simplified example is intended purely for educational purposes and does not cover all the complexities of real-world pentesting. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions before performing any penetration testing activities.
