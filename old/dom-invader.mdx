# DOM Invader


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> DOM Invader is a feature of the Burp Suite, a leading toolkit for web security testing. It is specifically designed to assist in the discovery of DOM-based vulnerabilities, which are security flaws residing in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web application. The fundamental concept underlying DOM Invader is the dynamic analysis of client-side scripts executing within the browser, thereby facilitating the identification of potential security risks.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> DOM-based vulnerabilities are a significant security concern, as they can allow malicious users to manipulate web content or perform actions on behalf of legitimate users. These vulnerabilities can be challenging to identify and mitigate, given the complexity of modern web applications and the increasing reliance on client-side scripting. As such, tools like DOM Invader are crucial for anyone involved in web security, from developers to penetration testers.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use DOM Invader, start by configuring your browser to use Burp Suite as its proxy server. Then, navigate to the web application you wish to test. As you interact with the application, DOM Invader will analyze the client-side scripts and identify potential vulnerabilities. It provides detailed information about each issue, including the affected script, the relevant DOM paths, and the potential impact. This information can then be used to develop and implement appropriate mitigation strategies.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> DOM Invader was introduced in 2019 as part of the Burp Suite Professional edition. Since then, it has become a valuable tool in the arsenal of many web security professionals and testers.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

DOM Invader works by instrumenting JavaScript code within the browser. As the code executes, DOM Invader collects data about potentially dangerous operations, such as the creation of HTML elements with user-controllable attributes, or the execution of JavaScript functions with user-controllable inputs. This data is then presented in a clear, intuitive interface, allowing the user to quickly identify areas of concern. Furthermore, DOM Invader also provides a 'Request Origin' feature, which can help determine whether a given JavaScript operation is the result of a HTTP request or a user action, further aiding in the identification and mitigation of DOM-based vulnerabilities.
