# GCP - Source Repositories Unauthenticated Enum


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP Source Repositories Unauthenticated Enum is a vulnerability that allows unauthorized users to enumerate (list out) source repositories on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This can lead to information disclosure as the attacker may gain access to sensitive information.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding this vulnerability is vital as it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information. If an attacker can list out the source repositories, they can potentially access the code and other sensitive data within the repository. This could lead to further attacks on the application or system, such as data breaches or system compromise.


### ⛏️ How ?

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would send unauthorized requests to the GCP Source Repositories API. By iterating through potential repository names, the attacker can identify existing repositories. The key to prevention is to always ensure that your repositories are private and require authentication for access. Regularly review and update access controls and permissions, and limit the number of users who have access to sensitive information.


### ⏳ When ?

This vulnerability has been a known issue for some time, with exploits and potential attacks being reported as early as 2018. However, as with many security vulnerabilities, it continues to be a potential risk as long as there are systems that have not been properly secured.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Source Repositories Unauthenticated Enum leverages the principle of insecure direct object references (IDOR). This occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input without proper authorization checks. In this case, the 'object' is the source repository. By manipulating the input (i.e., the repository name), an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the repository. This vulnerability can lead to various attacks, such as information disclosure, data tampering, and even full system compromise.
