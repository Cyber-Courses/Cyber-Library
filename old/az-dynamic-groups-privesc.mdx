# Az - Dynamic Groups Privesc


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Az - Dynamic Groups Privesc is a privilege escalation technique in Azure Active Directory (AD) that leverages Dynamic Group Membership. It allows an attacker to escalate privileges by manipulating the rules of dynamic group membership in Azure AD.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding and preventing Az - Dynamic Groups Privesc is essential for maintaining the security of cloud environments using Azure AD. This technique could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized administrative privileges, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.


### ⛏️ How ?

To protect against Az - Dynamic Groups Privesc, administrators should limit the ability to create or modify dynamic group membership rules to trusted individuals only. Additionally, using the principle of least privilege and regularly auditing dynamic group membership rules can help prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.


### ⏳ When ?

Az - Dynamic Groups Privesc has become a potential threat with the increasing adoption of Azure AD and dynamic groups for managing users and resources in cloud environments. It's crucial for organizations to be aware of this threat and take appropriate security measures.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Azure AD Dynamic Groups are a feature that automatically adds or removes members from a group based on certain conditions or rules. In a typical Az - Dynamic Groups Privesc scenario, an attacker who has the necessary permissions to manipulate these rules can add themselves to a group with higher privileges. The attacker could do this by modifying an existing rule or creating a new one. Once the Azure AD processes the modified or new rule, the attacker would be added to the privileged group, thereby escalating their privileges.
