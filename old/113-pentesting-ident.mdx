# 113 - Pentesting Ident


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Pentesting Ident 113 refers to penetration testing of the Ident Protocol, also known as Identification Protocol, which runs on port 113. This protocol is used to determine the identity of a user of a particular TCP connection.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding and potentially exploiting the Ident Protocol is important because it can disclose sensitive information, such as the username associated with a TCP connection, to unauthorized users. This information can be used by attackers to further infiltrate a system or network.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To pentest Ident 113, one would first need to scan the target system or network to check if port 113 is open. Tools like Nmap can be used for this purpose. If the port is open, various techniques can be used to query the Ident service and gather information. This includes using tools like netcat or even manual telnet sessions.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Pentesting Ident 113 became common practice as more systems started using the Ident Protocol, mainly in the 1980s and 1990s. Even today, it remains a relevant part of a pentester's toolkit as many systems still use this protocol.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

The Identification Protocol, or Ident Protocol, is defined by RFC 1413 and is a service that can be used to identify the user of a specific TCP connection. When given a pair of TCP ports, it returns a string of characters that identify the owner of that connection on the server's system. The Ident Protocol operates at the time of connection, after the completion of the TCP three-way handshake, but before any application data is sent.

This protocol is primarily used to provide auditing and accountability for network connections and can be queried by server processes to verify the identity of the user of a particular network service. This can be useful in network management and security, providing an additional layer of confirmation for user identities.

However, there can be vulnerabilities associated with this protocol. If the Ident Protocol is not correctly configured or if it's used without appropriate security measures, it can potentially expose sensitive information. For instance, unauthorized users might exploit the protocol to disclose the username associated with a TCP connection. This information could subsequently be used by attackers as part of a larger effort to infiltrate a system or network.

Therefore, it's important to ensure the proper configuration of the Ident Protocol and to maintain robust security measures when using it. This includes restricting access to the protocol, enforcing secure user authentication methods, and regularly monitoring network activity to detect any potential misuse or unauthorized access.

An example of how to pentest Ident 113 could be as follows:

1. **Scan the Target**: First, identify if port 113 is open on the target system. This can be done using Nmap, a popular network scanning tool. The command below scans the port 113 on the target IP address (replace "targetIP" with the actual IP address).

```bash
nmap -p 113 targetIP

```

1. **Query the Ident Service**: If port 113 is open, it's possible to query the Ident service. A tool like netcat can be used for this purpose. The following command could be used (replace "targetIP" with the actual IP address).

```bash
nc targetIP 113

```

This command will attempt to connect to the target IP address on port 113, and if successful, it will allow you to communicate with the Ident service.

1. **Interpret the Response**: The Ident service should respond with a string of characters that identify the owner of the connection. It is necessary to analyze and interpret this response to understand the potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Secure the Protocol**: If sensitive information is revealed, it indicates that the Ident Protocol on the target system is not correctly configured or is being used without appropriate security measures. It would be necessary to take steps to secure the protocol, such as restricting access, enforcing secure user authentication methods, and regularly monitoring network activity.

Please note that this is a hypothetical example and should only be used for educational purposes. Unauthorized penetration testing or hacking can be illegal and unethical.
