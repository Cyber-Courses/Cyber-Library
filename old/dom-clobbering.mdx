# Dom Clobbering


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

DOM Clobbering is a technique used in JavaScript that allows developers to access or manipulate HTML elements by their ID or name. It refers to the practice of defining properties on the global Window object that coincide with the ID or name of HTML elements on the page, which can lead to unexpected behavior in JavaScript code.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding DOM Clobbering is crucial for both web developers and security professionals. For developers, it can cause bugs and unexpected behavior in JavaScript applications if not properly accounted for. For security professionals, it can be used as an attack vector to exploit certain types of Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. Understanding DOM Clobbering can help in creating more secure and robust web applications.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use DOM Clobbering, you first need an HTML element with a specific ID or name. Then, in JavaScript, you can access this element as a property of the global Window object. For example, if you have an element with the ID 'test', you can access it in JavaScript using window.test. However, be wary of using this technique without understanding its implications, as it can lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities.


### ⏳ When ?

DOM Clobbering has been a feature of JavaScript since its earliest versions, but awareness of its potential security implications has grown in recent years. It's especially relevant in the context of modern web development, where complex JavaScript applications interact with the DOM in intricate ways.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

DOM Clobbering works due to the way JavaScript handles global variables and the DOM. When a script is executed in a browser, it runs in a global context, usually the Window object. Any variable declared in this global context becomes a property of the Window object. Similarly, the browser automatically creates properties on the Window object for every HTML element with an ID or name, allowing them to be accessed directly. This can lead to conflicts if a script declares a variable with the same name as an HTML element, 'clobbering' the element's reference and potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
