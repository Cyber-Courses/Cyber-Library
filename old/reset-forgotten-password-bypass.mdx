# Reset/Forgotten Password Bypass


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Reset/Forgotten Password Bypass is a common security vulnerability that allows unauthorized users to gain access to a system by bypassing the password recovery or reset process.


### 🧐 Why ?

This security vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, data breaches, and other severe implications. It's crucial for users and administrators to understand this vulnerability to protect their systems and data effectively.


### ⛏️ How ?

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker usually manipulates the process by which a user recovers or resets a forgotten password. This could involve intercepting recovery emails, guessing security questions, or exploiting system flaws.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of password reset or recovery features is common across many systems and applications, making Reset/Forgotten Password Bypass a persistent threat. It began to be widely exploited with the rise of internet services requiring user authentication in the early 2000s.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

The Reset/Forgotten Password Bypass vulnerability typically involves an attacker exploiting weaknesses in the password reset or recovery process. This could involve several techniques, including but not limited to: intercepting recovery emails through network sniffing, social engineering to guess or obtain answers to security questions, or exploiting flaws in the system's implementation of the password reset or recovery process, such as predictable tokens. The severity of this vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing secure practices in the design of the password recovery or reset process, such as using secure communication channels, employing strong encryption, and ensuring the unpredictability of password reset tokens.
