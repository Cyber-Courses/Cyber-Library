# 3306 - Pentesting Mysql


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

3306 - Pentesting MySQL refers to the process of performing a penetration test specifically on MySQL databases that typically run on port 3306. The goal is to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt the service.


### üßê¬†Why ?

Pentesting MySQL is crucial due to the prevalence of MySQL databases in many corporate and web environments. It's important to identify and fix these vulnerabilities to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity and availability of the database service. By understanding how to pentest MySQL, you can better safeguard your systems against potential database-related attacks.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

To pentest MySQL, first, you need to identify the target MySQL server. This can be done using various scanning tools such as Nmap. Once the target is identified, you can use tools like SQLMap or Hydra to perform SQL injection or brute force attacks respectively. Always remember to document your findings and make recommendations for improving the system's security.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Pentesting MySQL began gaining traction as more organizations recognized the importance of database security. It's a practice that should be conducted regularly, especially after major changes in the database structure or the application that interacts with it.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Pentesting MySQL involves a systematic approach to identify security vulnerabilities in a MySQL database, which runs on port 3306 by default. The process begins with reconnaissance, where the pentester uses tools such as Nmap to scan the network for open ports and find the target MySQL server.

After the scan, enumeration follows. In this step, pentesters use tools like SQLMap to gather more specific information about the MySQL version and to identify any potential vulnerabilities. SQLMap automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws, which are some of the most prevailing vulnerabilities in MySQL databases.

Once potential vulnerabilities have been identified, the pentester attempts to exploit these weaknesses. This could involve SQL injection, where malicious SQL code is inserted into a query, or brute-force attacks, where the pentester tries numerous combinations of credentials to gain access.

If these attacks are successful, the pentester may gain unauthorized access to the database. This could allow them to view, modify, or delete data, potentially causing significant harm to the organization's operations. In some cases, exploiting these vulnerabilities could even give the pentester control over the entire server.

It's important to remember that pentesting is a crucial component of a comprehensive security strategy. It helps organizations identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Regular pentesting is particularly important after major changes to the database structure or the applications that interact with it, as these changes can often introduce new vulnerabilities. Furthermore, conducting regular pentests is a requirement for compliance with many cybersecurity standards, demonstrating an organization's commitment to securing its data.

Here is a simple example of a MySQL pentest using the Nmap and SQLMap tools. This example is for educational purposes only.

1. **Reconnaissance**: First, we use Nmap to identify open ports and locate the target MySQL server. Nmap is a powerful tool for this purpose. The following command scans the target IP address (substitute with the target IP) for open TCP ports:

```bash
nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v [target IP address]

```

This command will return a list of open ports and the services running on them. If MySQL is running, it will typically be on port 3306.

1. **Enumeration**: After identifying the MySQL service, we use SQLMap to gather more specific information about the MySQL version and to identify any potential vulnerabilities.

```bash
sqlmap -u [target URL] --dbms=mysql --dump

```

This command tells SQLMap to test the specified URL and dump the database contents.

1. **Exploitation**: If SQLMap identifies an SQL injection vulnerability, it will attempt to exploit it. SQLMap automates this process, but it might look something like this if done manually:

```sql
' UNION ALL SELECT NULL, NULL, CONCAT(user,0x0a,password), NULL, NULL, NULL FROM mysql.user #

```

This SQL injection attempts to list all users and their hashed passwords from the MySQL user table.

1. **Post-Exploitation**: If exploitation is successful, the pentester may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. In this scenario, we might be able to see the usernames and hashed passwords of all users in the database.

Remember, this example is for illustrative purposes only. Never attempt to pentest a system without explicit, legal permission.
