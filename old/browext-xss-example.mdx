# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> BrowExt - XSS Example is an example of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, used to demonstrate how this type of cyberattack operates. XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into trusted websites, which are then executed by the user's browser.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding BrowExt - XSS Example is crucial for both web developers and cybersecurity professionals. For developers, it highlights the importance of securing their websites against XSS attacks. For cybersecurity professionals, it provides a practical example of how these attacks occur, aiding in the detection and prevention of such threats.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> BrowExt - XSS Example operates by exploiting a vulnerability in a website's user input fields. An attacker would inject a malicious JavaScript code into these fields, which is then stored on the website's server. When another user visits the affected page, the script is executed in their browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or perform other harmful actions.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

In XSS attacks, the attacker uses a web application as a conduit to send malicious code, usually in the form of a browser side script, to an end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user in the output it generates without validating or encoding it. BrowExt - XSS Example demonstrates this by injecting a malicious script into a user input field. This script is then stored and served by the website's server to other users. When these users visit the affected page, their browser will download and run the script. This can lead to various harmful outcomes, such as theft of the user's cookies or sessions tokens, or performing actions on their behalf.
