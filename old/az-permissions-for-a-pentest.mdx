Microsoft Azure uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define permissions. In the context of a Pentest, permissions are typically granted in accordance with the 'Principle of Least Privilege', which means providing only those access rights that are essential for performing the Pentest. These permissions could range from read-only access to certain services, to full control over others, depending on the Pentest requirements. It's important to note that Azure permissions should be configured carefully to prevent accidental disruptions or damages to the services. Also, permissions should be revoked immediately after the Pentest to reduce potential security risks.
