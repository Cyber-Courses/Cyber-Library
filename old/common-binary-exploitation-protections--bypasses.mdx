# Common Binary Exploitation Protections & Bypasses


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Common Binary Exploitation Protections and Bypasses refer to the strategies and mechanisms used to protect and secure binary files from various security vulnerabilities and attacks. They are typically implemented to prevent attackers from exploiting certain weaknesses in binary files to gain unauthorized access or control over a system.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> In the world of cybersecurity, the protection of binary files is of great importance due to the role they play in the execution of various computer programs and systems. Binary files can be vulnerable to a wide range of security threats, including buffer overflow attacks, format string vulnerabilities, and more. By understanding how to implement and bypass common binary exploitation protections, cybersecurity professionals can better anticipate and prevent potential security breaches.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Implementing common binary exploitation protections involves a combination of techniques, including but not limited to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Stack Canaries, Control Flow Integrity (CFI), and Non-Executable Stack. However, these protections are not foolproof and can be bypassed by sophisticated attackers using methods such as Return Oriented Programming (ROP), NOP-sled technique, and by exploiting certain flaws in the protections themselves. As such, constant vigilance, regular updates, and comprehensive security audits are crucial in maintaining the security of binary files.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> The use of common binary exploitation protections and bypasses has been a standard practice in the field of cybersecurity for many years. However, as attack methods continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, so too must the protective measures put in place to guard against them.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Binary exploitation revolves around the concept of memory corruption, where an attacker manipulates a program's memory to modify its behavior or gain unauthorized access. It is a critical concern in cybersecurity as it can lead to serious breaches.

Key protections against binary exploitation include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Stack Canaries, and Control Flow Integrity (CFI).

ASLR randomizes the memory address space locations of key areas of a process, which makes it challenging for an attacker to predict target addresses. However, a persistent attacker can use 'brute-forcing' to eventually find the correct memory addresses by repeatedly exploiting a vulnerability.

Stack Canaries are protective measures that involve placing a small integer, the 'canary', in a known location on the stack before local variables are allocated. If the canary changes, an overflow has occurred, and the process can be halted safely. However, if an overflow vulnerability exists that allows the attacker to control the canary's value, this protection can be bypassed.

CFI is a security mechanism that prevents an attacker from changing the intended control flow of a program. It adds checks to ensure the control flow does not deviate from the intended path. Yet, sophisticated attackers can bypass CFI by crafting inputs that meet the checks' requirements.

Even though these protections significantly enhance security, they are not foolproof and need to be paired with other security measures. Regular software updates, ongoing threat monitoring, and comprehensive security audits are essential in maintaining the security of binary files. A multi-layered approach to security is beneficial, as it provides multiple barriers an attacker needs to overcome, increasing the chances of detection and prevention.

Let's look at a simple example of a Buffer Overflow attack and how Stack Canaries can protect against it.

Consider a C program with a function that copies any input it receives to a buffer:

```c
void unsafe_function(char *input) {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, input);
}

```

If we call `unsafe_function` with a string that's longer than 10 characters, we'll overwrite memory that comes after the buffer. An attacker could use this to overwrite the return address of the function and make the program jump to any address, potentially executing malicious code.

Now, let's see how a Stack Canary can protect against this. When a function with a Stack Canary is called, a random value (the Canary) is placed on the stack. Before the function returns, it checks if the Canary has changed. If it has, the function knows a buffer overflow occurred and it can halt safely. This could look something like:

```c
void safe_function(char *input) {
    char buffer[10];
    unsigned long canary = random();
    strcpy(buffer, input);
    if (canary != random()) {
        printf("Buffer overflow detected!");
        exit(-1);
    }
}

```

In this version of the function, an attacker cannot overwrite the return address without also changing the Canary. But because the Canary is random, the attacker cannot predict its value to overwrite it correctly, and the overflow is detected.

It's important to note that this is a simplified example. In real systems, the Canary is usually placed between the local variables and the return address, and it's not as simple as just calling `random()`. Also, more sophisticated protections like ASLR and CFI would be used in conjunction with Stack Canaries. However, this example should give you a basic understanding of how Stack Canaries work.
