# 1080 - Pentesting Socks


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

> 1080 - Pentesting Socks is a proxy protocol that is widely used in penetration testing and cybersecurity to bypass network filters and firewalls. It allows a user to route their network traffic through a third-party server, effectively hiding their real IP address and location.
> 

### 🧐 Why ?

> Understanding and using 1080 - Pentesting Socks is important because it is a common tool used in both penetration testing and malicious hacking. It helps identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a system's network security. For cybersecurity professionals, understanding how to use and defend against this protocol is crucial.
> 

### ⛏️ How ?

> To use 1080 - Pentesting Socks, you first need to set up a SOCKS proxy server. This can be done using software such as Shadowsocks or Dante. Once the server is set up, you need to configure your system or application to use the proxy server. This usually involves specifying the server's IP address and port (usually 1080 for SOCKS).
> 

### ⏳ When ?

> The SOCKS protocol was first introduced in the early 1990s and has been used in penetration testing and cybersecurity ever since. Its use has grown more prevalent with the rise of the internet and the increasing need for secure, anonymous communication.

# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

The SOCKS protocol is a versatile networking protocol used for routing network traffic through a proxy server, allowing clients to bypass network filters and firewalls. This process begins with a handshake between the client and the server. During the handshake, the client specifies the destination IP address and port.

Following the handshake, the SOCKS server establishes a connection with the destination on the client's behalf, effectively becoming a middleman. All data is then relayed between the client and the destination through the SOCKS server. This means that all outbound traffic appears to originate from the proxy server, not the client's actual IP address, providing the client with a level of anonymity.

However, it's important to note that while SOCKS can provide anonymity, it does not inherently encrypt network traffic. This means that, without additional security measures, the data being sent and received can potentially be intercepted and read by third parties. For this reason, SOCKS is often used in conjunction with security measures like VPNs or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to ensure data privacy and integrity.

VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, create an encrypted tunnel for data transmission, preventing third parties from viewing the data. On the other hand, TLS is a protocol that provides end-to-end communications security over networks and is widely used for internet communications and online transactions.

Therefore, when using SOCKS for sensitive tasks like penetration testing or secure communication, it's essential to pair it with other security practices to ensure your network traffic is not only rerouted but also secure from potential eavesdropping.

For example, if you were to use SOCKS with SSH (Secure Shell) for secure communication, you might follow these steps:

1. **Set up an SSH tunnel**. This can be done using the `D` option in the SSH command, which stands for “dynamic port forwarding”. This option turns SSH into a SOCKS proxy server. Here's an example of the command you might use:

```bash
ssh -D 8080 -f -C -q -N user@example.com

```

In this command:

- `D 8080` sets up a SOCKS proxy on port 8080.
- `f` sends SSH to the background.
- `C` compresses the data before sending it.
- `q` enables quiet mode.
- `N` tells SSH that no command will be sent once the tunnel is up.
- `user@example.com` is the user and host to which you want to connect.
1. **Configure your application to use the SOCKS proxy**. This will depend on the specific application you're using. For instance, in Firefox, you'd go to Preferences > General > Network Settings, select 'Manual proxy configuration', enter 'localhost' as the SOCKS Host, and '8080' as the port (or whatever port you used in step 1).
2. **Secure your data**. As mentioned, SOCKS does not inherently encrypt network traffic. In this case, SSH is providing the encryption. SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow the remote computer to authenticate the user, if necessary.
3. **Test your setup**. You can test if your traffic is being routed through the proxy by visiting a site like [https://www.whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/). The IP displayed should be the IP of your SSH server, not your local IP.

Remember, this is a simplified example. Depending on the specifics of your network and what you're trying to achieve, you might need to use more advanced configurations or additional security measures.
