# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, BrowExt operates by interfacing with the browser's existing permissions API. It fetches the list of permissions granted to each website or application and presents it in a user-friendly format. Users can then modify these permissions, and the changes are reflected back in the API. This ensures that the browser enforces these changes when interacting with the respective websites or applications.
