# 23 - Pentesting Telnet


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Pentesting Telnet refers to the process of testing the security of a Telnet service, which is a user command and an underlying TCP/IP protocol for accessing remote computers. The fundamental concepts underpinning pentesting Telnet revolve around the principles of network security, ethical hacking, and network protocols.


### 🧐 Why ?

Pentesting Telnet is crucial because the Telnet protocol, although quite old and largely replaced by SSH, is still used in some environments, and it is known for its lack of security features. It transmits communication in plain text which can be intercepted and read by malicious attackers. Therefore, understanding how to test and secure a Telnet service is important to maintain the overall security of a network.


### ⛏️ How ?

To perform pentesting on a Telnet service, you need to first identify the target system running the Telnet service. This can be done using various scanning tools like Nmap. Once identified, you can use Telnet clients to connect to the service and try exploiting known vulnerabilities. Tools like Metasploit can be used for exploiting these vulnerabilities.


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of pentesting Telnet started gaining prominence in the late 90s and early 2000s with the rise of ethical hacking and the need for improved network security.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

Pentesting Telnet is a comprehensive process that involves multiple stages.

In the first stage, reconnaissance, the aim is to gather as much information as possible about the target system and the Telnet service running on it. Tools like Nmap are typically used in this stage. Nmap, or Network Mapper, is a free and open-source tool that discovers hosts and services on a computer network. It does this by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

Once the target system and the Telnet service have been identified, the next stage is scanning for vulnerabilities. This involves probing the system to identify any weak points that could be exploited. Tools often used for this purpose include Nessus and OpenVAS. Nessus is a proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable Network Security, and OpenVAS is a free software framework that includes several services and tools for vulnerability scanning and management.

If any vulnerabilities are identified during the scanning stage, the next step is exploitation. In this stage, various tools and techniques are used to exploit the identified vulnerabilities. One of the most commonly used tools for exploitation is Metasploit, a cybersecurity tool that aids in the discovery, exploitation, and mitigation of security vulnerabilities.

The final stage of pentesting Telnet is reporting. In this stage, the findings from the scanning and exploitation stages are documented. This typically includes detailing the vulnerabilities that were found, the exploitation techniques that were used, the potential impact of the vulnerabilities, and suggestions for mitigations. This report can then be used by the organization to understand their security posture better and to implement measures to improve their security.

Here's a detailed, educational example of a pentesting process on a Telnet service:

**Stage 1: Reconnaissance**
In this stage, we want to identify the target system running the Telnet service. We can use Nmap for this. For instance, we execute the following command:

```bash
nmap -p 23 192.168.1.0/24

```

This command will scan the network 192.168.1.0/24 for hosts with port 23 (Telnet's default port) open.

**Stage 2: Scanning for Vulnerabilities**
Once we have identified a system running Telnet, we can probe for vulnerabilities. We can use a tool like Nessus. After installing Nessus, we can create a new scan targeting the identified IP address. Nessus will then provide a report detailing any vulnerabilities found.

**Stage 3: Exploitation**
Suppose Nessus identified a known vulnerability in the Telnet service. We could then use Metasploit to exploit this vulnerability. First, we search for the exploit in Metasploit:

```bash
msf search [vulnerability identifier]

```

Once we've identified the exploit we want to use, we set it up and set the target:

```bash
msf use [exploit path]
msf set RHOSTS [target IP]
msf exploit

```

This will launch the exploit against the target system.

**Stage 4: Reporting**
Finally, we document our findings. This would include the identified vulnerabilities, the used exploits, the potential impacts, and suggested mitigations. This report can then be used to improve the system's security.
