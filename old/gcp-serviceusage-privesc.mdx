# GCP - Serviceusage Privesc


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Serviceusage Privesc is a cybersecurity concept that refers to the privilege escalation vulnerabilities within the GCP's Service Usage API. This API allows users to enable or disable services in their GCP projects, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over these services.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding GCP Serviceusage Privesc is crucial as it is a potential security threat to organizations that use GCP for their cloud services. If exploited, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or take control of critical services. Therefore, cybersecurity professionals, cloud architects, and system administrators should be aware of this issue to protect their organization's data and services.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Implementing secure practices is essential to mitigate the risk of GCP Serviceusage Privesc. Regularly review and update the IAM roles and permissions, limiting service usage to only necessary services, and continuously monitoring the API usage are some of the effective ways to prevent misuse. As always, adhering to the principle of 'least privilege' is key when assigning access rights.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> With the increasing adoption of cloud services like GCP, the risk of Serviceusage Privesc has become a significant concern in recent years. It is especially relevant now as more organizations are migrating their services to the cloud.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

GCP Serviceusage Privesc, at its core, is a privilege escalation vulnerability that arises from the misuse of the GCP Service Usage API. This API allows users to manage the services in their GCP projects, but if not correctly secured, it can be exploited to enable or disable services without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized access to data, disruption of services, or even a full takeover of the GCP project. To prevent this, it is crucial to implement strong access control policies, regularly monitor API usage, and limit the use of services to those necessary for the functioning of the project.
