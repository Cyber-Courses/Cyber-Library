# Cache Poisoning to DoS


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Cache Poisoning to DoS is a type of cyber attack where an attacker corrupts a DNS server by replacing a legitimate IP address in its cache with a fake one. The purpose of this attack is often to make a particular website's addresses and corresponding names inaccessible, effectively causing a Denial of Service (DoS) to its users.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding Cache Poisoning to DoS is important for both network administrators and users. For administrators, it can help them to protect their DNS servers from being exploited, keeping their systems operational and their users safe. For users, it can help them understand the potential risks they face when using the internet and take appropriate precautions.


### ⛏️ How ?

To protect against Cache Poisoning to DoS, administrators can implement certain security measures. These include using DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions), which adds a digital signature to DNS data to ensure its authenticity, and implementing a network infrastructure that does not allow recursive queries from outside of the network.


### ⏳ When ?

Cache Poisoning to DoS attacks have been used by cyber criminals since the early days of the internet. They were first documented in the 1990s but continue to be a threat today due to the ongoing reliance on DNS for internet navigation.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

The process of Cache Poisoning to DoS involves an attacker sending a flood of responses to a DNS server, hoping that one of them will match a request made by a user. This matching response is then stored in the server's cache as the valid IP address for the requested name. From then on, any requests for that name will be directed to the attacker's IP address instead of the legitimate one. As a result, users are denied access to the actual website, effectively experiencing a DoS.
