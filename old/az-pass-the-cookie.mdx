### 🧐 Why ?

This technique is important because it allows hackers to bypass traditional authentication methods. It can also be used to gain access to sensitive information, making it a serious security threat. Understanding this technique can help network administrators and cybersecurity professionals better protect their networks.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use the Az - Pass the Cookie technique, a hacker first needs to capture a user's session cookie. This can be done through methods like phishing or man-in-the-middle attacks. Once the cookie is captured, the hacker can use it to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the network.

# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At a technical level, the Az - Pass the Cookie technique involves capturing a user's session cookie and using it to impersonate that user. Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's computer that contain information about the user's session. By capturing this cookie, a hacker can effectively 'become' the user for the duration of the session. This allows the hacker to bypass authentication methods and gain access to sensitive information. To protect against this type of attack, network administrators should regularly clear session cookies and enforce strong authentication methods.
