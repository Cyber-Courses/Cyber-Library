### üëÄ¬†What ?

> PHP Tricks Pentesting is a method used in cybersecurity to exploit vulnerabilities within a PHP-based application. PHP, a popular scripting language for web development, can sometimes be exploited via certain 'tricks' or techniques.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Understanding PHP Tricks Pentesting is crucial for both web developers and cybersecurity professionals. For developers, it helps them write more secure code by understanding how attackers might exploit their applications. For cybersecurity professionals, it provides a toolkit for testing the security of PHP applications.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Pentesting with PHP tricks involves several steps including information gathering, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation. Information gathering involves learning as much as possible about the PHP application, including its structure, functionality, and potential weak points. Vulnerability scanning is the process of systematically checking for known vulnerabilities. Exploitation involves trying to leverage any identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the application's normal functioning.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> PHP Tricks Pentesting has been in use since the early 2000s, shortly after PHP became a staple in web development. It becomes particularly relevant when dealing with legacy systems, or when new vulnerabilities are discovered in the PHP language.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

PHP Tricks Pentesting is a complex field that requires a detailed understanding of the PHP language and common vulnerabilities that can occur within it. This form of penetration testing is built on the knowledge of how PHP works and the frequent errors developers make when using it. A key aspect of this is the concept of 'loose comparisons'. In PHP, due to its dynamic type system, certain different values can be treated as equal. This can be exploited in a number of ways, for instance, to bypass password checks.

Another common trick in PHP Pentesting involves code injection through unsanitized user input. This is when input provided by a user is used directly in a PHP function without proper sanitization or validation. If an attacker can pass malicious code as input, it could be executed by the server, leading to a variety of potential security issues including data breaches or server takeover.

The technical execution of these tricks requires a deep understanding of the PHP language, its quirks, and general principles of software security. It is not only about finding and exploiting vulnerabilities but also about thinking like an attacker to understand the potential weak points in an application and how they could be misused.

Furthermore, it's important to stay updated with the latest developments in the PHP language and security best practices as new vulnerabilities can be discovered over time. In-depth knowledge in areas such as secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning, and security testing methods is also crucial in the field of PHP Tricks Pentesting.

For instance, consider a simple PHP login system that uses 'loose comparisons' during password verification:

```php
$user_input = $_POST['password'];
$stored_password = get_password_from_database(); // Let's assume it returns '12345'

if ($user_input == $stored_password) {
    // Grant access
}

```

In PHP, the '==' operator performs a loose comparison, which can lead to unexpected equalities. For example, the string '12345' is considered equal to the string '12345abc' when compared with '=='. So, if a user inputs '12345abc' as their password, they will still be granted access.

To mitigate this, you should use the '===' operator, which performs a strict comparison:

```php
if ($user_input === $stored_password) {
    // Grant access
}

```

For the second example, let's consider a PHP code that doesn't properly sanitize user input:

```php
$user_input = $_POST['username'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $user_input . "'";
$result = mysqli_query($connection, $query);

```

In this case, if the user input is `admin'; DROP TABLE users; --`, the query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'; DROP TABLE users; --'

```

This is a SQL Injection attack that will delete the 'users' table. Always sanitize and validate user inputs:

```php
$user_input = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, $_POST['username']);
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $user_input . "'";
$result = mysqli_query($connection, $query);

```

In the above examples, the key steps are understanding the PHP language's quirks, identifying the potential weak points, and knowing how to mitigate them.
