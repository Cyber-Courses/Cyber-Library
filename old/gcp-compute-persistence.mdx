# GCP - Compute Persistence


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Persistence is the feature that allows a user to reserve computing resources, such as virtual machines, for a specified period. This ensures that the resources are always available for use, even when there are fluctuations in demand.


### 🧐 Why ?

Compute Persistence on GCP is important because it allows users to maintain a consistent environment for their applications. This is especially crucial for businesses that run mission-critical applications, where any downtime can lead to significant losses. Moreover, it helps in optimizing costs by allowing users to pay only for the resources they reserve, rather than having to pay for peak capacity.


### ⛏️ How ?

To implement Compute Persistence on GCP, you need to create a reservation. This can be done by navigating to the 'VM instances' section in the GCP console, clicking on 'Reserve', and then specifying the details of the reservation, such as the number of CPUs, the amount of memory, and the duration of the reservation. Once the reservation is created, GCP will automatically allocate the specified resources to your account, ensuring they are always available for use.


### ⏳ When ?

The use of Compute Persistence in GCP started when businesses began to realize the need for consistent and reliable cloud resources. The feature has since become an integral part of GCP, with many businesses relying on it to ensure the smooth operation of their applications.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

At the technical level, Compute Persistence on GCP works by allocating a specific portion of the cloud provider's resources to the user's account. These resources are then 'reserved', meaning they cannot be used by other users. This ensures that the resources are always available for the user, regardless of the overall demand for resources. To achieve this, GCP uses advanced resource scheduling algorithms, which ensure that resources are allocated in a way that maximizes efficiency and minimizes cost.
