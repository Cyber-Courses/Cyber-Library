# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

At the technical level, Azure Logic Apps is built on a serverless computing platform. This means that users do not need to manage any servers or infrastructure, and can instead focus on designing their workflows. Azure Logic Apps uses a graphical interface to represent workflows, making it easy for users to understand and modify their workflows. Under the hood, Logic Apps is based on the Workflow Definition Language (WDL), a JSON-based language that defines workflows in Azure Logic Apps. This provides a high level of flexibility and control, allowing users to create complex workflows that meet their specific needs.
