# GCP - Pub/Sub Post Exploitation


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a messaging service that allows independent systems to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. Pub/Sub stands for 'Publisher-Subscriber', a pattern that provides real-time messaging, streaming, and queuing capabilities. Post Exploitation refers to the phase in a cyber attack where the attacker has gained access and is now focused on achieving his specific goals within the target system, which could range from data theft to system manipulation.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding the concept of Post Exploitation in GCP Pub/Sub is vital as it can be an avenue for attackers to exploit vulnerable systems. If not properly secured, Pub/Sub can serve as a gateway for attackers to infiltrate, steal sensitive data, or even gain control over the entire infrastructure. Hence, it's crucial for cybersecurity professionals to understand how post exploitation can occur in Pub/Sub to fortify their defenses and respond swiftly to potential threats.


### ⛏️ How ?

To use GCP Pub/Sub for post exploitation, an attacker might first gain access to a system with Pub/Sub permissions. They could then subscribe to sensitive topics and pull messages containing sensitive data. They could also publish malicious messages into the system. To mitigate this, one should follow best security practices such as principle of least privilege, encrypt sensitive data before publishing, validate and sanitize data before processing, and monitor Pub/Sub activities for any suspicious behavior.


### ⏳ When ?

The practice of post exploitation on GCP Pub/Sub can occur once an attacker has gained access to a system with permissions to the Pub/Sub service. This could be due to weak security configurations, lack of monitoring, or successful phishing attacks.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

GCP Pub/Sub operates on the principle of real-time message passing between publisher applications that generate messages and subscriber applications that process them. Post exploitation in this context refers to the misuse of this service after an attacker has gained access. They could listen to topics containing sensitive messages or inject harmful messages into the system. This is possible due to the loosely coupled nature of Pub/Sub, where publishers and subscribers do not need to be aware of each other's existence. Therefore, it's critical to enforce strict access controls, data encryption, and continuous monitoring to prevent and detect such activities.
