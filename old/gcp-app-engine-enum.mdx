# GCP - App Engine Enum


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale. You can choose from several popular languages, libraries, and frameworks to develop your apps, then let App Engine take care of provisioning servers and scaling your app instances based on demand.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> App Engine allows developers to focus on writing code, while Google handles the infrastructure management tasks. This enables rapid application development and deployment. It is also efficient for handling applications that need to scale, as it automatically allocates resources in response to traffic patterns. Because of these features, understanding GCP App Engine is important for developers working on scalable web applications.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To use GCP's App Engine, start by setting up a Google Cloud account. Install the Google Cloud SDK to your development environment and initialize it. Then, create a new project on the Google Cloud Console and initialize the App Engine for the project specifying the language (Java, Python, Node.js etc.). Write your application using the desired language and then deploy it using the command 'gcloud app deploy'. You can manage your application through the Google Cloud Console.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> App Engine was first introduced by Google in 2008 as a platform-as-a-service for running web applications. Since then, it has been adopted by numerous developers and organizations for running applications that serve millions of users.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Underneath the hood, GCP App Engine operates on Google's infrastructure. It abstracts away the underlying complexities of managing individual server units, allowing developers to operate at the level of the application. The platform supports apps written in several programming languages. It also supports frameworks that can be installed via the standard package manager for the language. App Engine automatically scales depending on your app's traffic. It includes built-in services and APIs such as NoSQL databases, in-memory caching, and user authentication API. It also supports Docker images, which means you can bring any library or system package that can be containerized.
