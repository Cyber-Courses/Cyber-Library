# Angular pentesting


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Angular pentesting is the process of testing an Angular-based web application for security vulnerabilities. Angular, developed by Google, is a popular framework for building web applications.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Angular pentesting is crucial because Angular applications are widely used on the internet. It's important to ensure these applications are secure to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches. By understanding how to identify vulnerabilities in Angular applications, developers and security professionals can better protect their applications and data.
> 

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> To conduct Angular pentesting, one might start by mapping the application to understand its structure and functionality. Then, they would use various tools and techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting or SQL injection. These vulnerabilities can then be exploited to understand their impact and propose mitigations.
> 

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Angular pentesting should be performed during the development phase of an Angular application to catch and fix security vulnerabilities early. It should also be done whenever updates or changes are made to the application.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

---

Angular pentesting involves various technical aspects. It includes understanding Angular's architecture, such as its use of modules, components, and services. It also includes understanding common security vulnerabilities in web applications, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and cross-site request forgery, and how they can be exploited in an Angular application. Furthermore, it involves using various tools, such as security scanners and proxy tools, to identify potential vulnerabilities. Finally, it involves understanding how to mitigate these vulnerabilities, such as by using secure coding practices or implementing security controls.
