# Flask pentesting


# üëâ¬†Overview

### üëÄ¬†What ?

Flask pentesting is the process of performing penetration testing on web applications built with Flask, a popular Python web framework. The purpose of Flask pentesting is to identify potential security vulnerabilities within a Flask application and to mitigate them before attackers can exploit them.


### üßê¬†Why ?

In the era of digital transformation, web applications have become a common target for cyber attackers. Flask, being a widely used Python web framework, is no exception. Flask pentesting is important because it helps to identify and fix vulnerabilities in Flask applications, thus enhancing their security and reliability. It's also a requirement in many regulatory standards such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001. Therefore, anyone responsible for developing or managing Flask applications should be interested in Flask pentesting.


### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

Flask pentesting involves several steps, including information gathering, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation. Tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite can be used for scanning and exploitation. For manual testing, one needs to understand the Flask framework's architecture, its request and response objects, URL routing, template engine, and security mechanisms such as CSRF protection and session management. The ultimate goal is to identify common vulnerabilities like SQLi, XSS, CSRF, command injection, path traversal, etc., and to validate the effectiveness of security controls.


### ‚è≥¬†When ?

Flask pentesting should be done throughout the entire lifecycle of the Flask application, from development to deployment. It's now a common practice to integrate security testing into the CI/CD pipeline, which is known as DevSecOps. However, Flask pentesting gained major traction in recent years with the rise of Python's popularity for web development and the increase in cyber threats.


# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

Flask penetration testing, or pentesting, is an essential security practice that aims at probing Flask web applications for potential vulnerabilities. Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, is often used to develop web applications. However, like any other software, Flask applications can have security vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by attackers.

At a technical level, Flask pentesting involves an in-depth understanding of how Flask applications operate and where they might be vulnerable. As a micro-framework, Flask has a compact and comprehensible code base. However, it heavily relies on extensions and decorators for various functionalities such as form validation, user authentication, and database abstraction. When these elements are not utilized correctly, they can introduce vulnerabilities into the application.

In addition to understanding the Flask framework itself, pentesters should also be knowledgeable about the broader ecosystem in which Flask operates. For instance, Flask applications are often deployed using Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) servers, which might have their own vulnerabilities. Therefore, a comprehensive Flask pentesting approach should include an examination of these deployment environments.

Moreover, since Flask is a Python-based framework, familiarity with the Python programming language is crucial for pentesters. Understanding the application's code not only aids in detecting vulnerabilities but also helps pentesters devise ways of exploiting these vulnerabilities to demonstrate their potential impact. This provides a clear picture of potential security risks and helps in prioritizing fixes.

Flask pentesting involves several stages, including information gathering, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation. The information gathering phase involves understanding the application's functionality, architecture, and the technologies used. Vulnerability scanning can be performed using automated tools, but manual testing is also crucial to identify issues that automated tools might miss.

Exploitation involves attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to understand their impact, while post-exploitation activities might include trying to escalate privileges or access sensitive data. This entire process helps ensure the security of Flask applications by identifying vulnerabilities and providing recommendations to mitigate them.

An example of Flask pentesting could involve a simple Flask application with a user login feature. Here's a simple Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////tmp/test.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True)
    password = db.Column(db.String(120))

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username, password=password).first()
    if user:
        return "Login Successful"
    else:
        return "Invalid Credentials"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()
    app.run(debug=True)

```

This application has a `User` model and a `/login` route that checks if a user exists with the provided username and password.

**Step 1: Information Gathering**

In this step, an attacker might identify that the application is using SQLite as a database and Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM. The application also seems to have a user login feature.

**Step 2: Vulnerability Scanning**

The attacker might notice that there is no protection against SQL Injection in the login route.

**Step 3: Exploitation**

The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a POST request to the login route with a payload that manipulates the SQL query, such as `' OR '1'='1`. This would result in all users being selected, and the first one would be returned, effectively bypassing the login.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "username=' OR '1'='1&password=any" <http://localhost:5000/login

```

**Step 4: Post-exploitation**

After gaining access, the attacker might try to escalate privileges or access sensitive data.

This example demonstrates how a simple Flask application can be vulnerable to SQL Injection. The vulnerability could be mitigated by using parameterized queries or an ORM that escapes user input, such as Flask-SQLAlchemy's filter method.
