# GCP - KMS Privesc


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

GCP - KMS Privesc refers to a privilege escalation vulnerability in Google Cloud Platform's Key Management Service. It is a security issue where an attacker with basic user permissions can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated access, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding GCP - KMS Privesc is crucial due to the growing reliance on cloud services and the increasing sophistication of cyber threats. Misconfigurations in cloud services can lead to severe security incidents, including data breaches, making it a high priority to understand and mitigate such vulnerabilities. Furthermore, knowledge of such vulnerabilities is necessary for both penetration testers and system administrators to ensure secure cloud environments.


### ⛏️ How ?

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker with basic permissions can request for decryption keys from the KMS, which are normally restricted. By exploiting this misconfiguration, they can decrypt sensitive information. To mitigate this, it's crucial to follow best practices in cloud security, such as limiting permissions based on the principle of least privilege, regularly auditing and monitoring activity and implementing strong access controls.


### ⏳ When ?

The use and exploitation of GCP - KMS Privesc became more prominent with the increasing adoption of cloud services. Misconfigurations in cloud settings are a common occurrence due to their complexity and the fast-paced nature of cloud environments.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

In a typical scenario, Google Cloud's KMS should restrict decryption key access to only users with explicit permissions. However, in a misconfigured environment, these restrictions are not properly enforced. An attacker can exploit this by making a request for a decryption key. If successful, the attacker can then use this key to decrypt sensitive data, leading to a data breach. Key to preventing such privilege escalation is proper configuration and permission management. Regular audits and monitoring can help detect unusual activity early and remediate it. Furthermore, adhering to the principle of least privilege, where users are given the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their tasks, can significantly reduce the risk.
