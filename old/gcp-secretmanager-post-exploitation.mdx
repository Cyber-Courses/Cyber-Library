# GCP - Secretmanager Post Exploitation


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

> Google Cloud Platform's Secret Manager is a secure and convenient storage system for API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data. Post Exploitation refers to the phase in a cyber attack where the system has already been breached and the attacker is using the compromised system to achieve his objectives.
> 

### 🧐 Why ?

> Understanding GCP Secret Manager post exploitation is crucial for both attackers and defenders. For attackers, it provides a potential vector to gain further access or exfiltrate sensitive data. For defenders, understanding the risks associated with GCP Secret Manager can lead to better protection strategies.
> 

### ⛏️ How ?

> To utilize GCP Secret Manager for post exploitation, an attacker first needs access to the GCP environment, which could be obtained through phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, etc. Once inside, they can use GCP Secret Manager to access stored secrets. Defenders can mitigate this by regularly auditing their GCP environments, strictly managing access, and encrypting sensitive data.
> 

### ⏳ When ?

> The use of GCP Secret Manager for post exploitation has become more prevalent with the increasing adoption of cloud services. As more organizations migrate their infrastructure to GCP, the potential for misuse of services like Secret Manager increases.

# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

In a typical attack scenario, an attacker with access to the GCP environment can use Google's SDKs or APIs to access the Secret Manager. They can retrieve stored secrets, which can then be used to escalate privileges, move laterally within the network, or exfiltrate data. Defenders can mitigate this by implementing least privilege access, encrypting data at rest and in transit, and regularly monitoring and auditing their environment for suspicious activity.
