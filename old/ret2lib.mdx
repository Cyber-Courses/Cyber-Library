# Ret2lib


# 👉 Overview

---

### 👀 What ?

Ret2lib is a method of exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in a program. It's a technique used to execute arbitrary code despite the presence of security measures.


### 🧐 Why ?

Understanding Ret2lib is essential due to the role it plays in cybersecurity. It is a common method used in cyber attacks to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Understanding this technique can help in building more secure systems and in detecting and preventing potential attacks.


### ⛏️ How ?

Ret2lib works by overwriting the return address of a function with the address of a function present in a library (like libc), which is already loaded in the process's memory space. It's commonly used to call system functions like 'system' or 'execve' to spawn a shell. The attack is performed by overflowing a buffer variable and overwriting the saved return address on the stack with the address of the desired library function.


### ⏳ When ?

The usage of Ret2lib technique began in the late 1990s and early 2000s when protections against executing code on the stack were introduced. This led to attackers finding ways around these protections, leading to the development of the Ret2lib technique.


# ⚙️ Technical Explanations

---

In order to understand the intricacies of Ret2lib, it's essential to understand how function calls work in a program. When a function is called, the return address is pushed onto the stack. Then, local variables are created on the stack for the function to use. If a buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this function, an attacker can write more data into the buffer than it can hold, overwriting the saved return address on the stack. In a Ret2lib attack, the overwritten return address points to a library function, effectively causing this function to be executed next. This can be used to perform malicious actions such as spawning a shell. Understanding this process is key in preventing Ret2lib attacks by ensuring proper buffer management and employing security measures such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
