## Security Champion: Driving Secure Development Practices

In the realm of application security, a Security Champion plays a crucial role by advocating for secure development practices across development teams. Unlike other roles that may focus solely on security testing or code review, Security Champions are embedded within development teams themselves. Their primary objective is to foster a strong security culture and ensure that security considerations are woven into the fabric of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

### Responsibilities and Objectives

A Security Champion serves as a bridge between security teams and developers, ensuring that security best practices are consistently applied throughout the development process. They are responsible for educating team members about potential security risks, offering training on secure coding techniques, and providing ongoing support and resources related to security issues. The goal is to create a proactive security environment where developers feel empowered to identify and address security vulnerabilities as they arise.

### Essential Skills and Competencies

**Technical Skills**: Security Champions need a solid understanding of application security principles, including threat modeling, vulnerability analysis, and familiarity with common security tools like static and dynamic analysis tools. They should be proficient in programming languages relevant to their organization’s tech stack and knowledgeable about secure coding practices specific to those languages.

**Soft Skills**: Communication is key for a Security Champion. The ability to convey complex security concepts in an understandable manner to non-security experts is essential. They should also possess strong leadership and interpersonal skills to effectively advocate for security within their teams. Problem-solving skills are also important as they help teammates navigate security challenges.

### Work Environment and Tools

Security Champions usually work within software development teams and participate in regular sprint cycles, stand-ups, and other agile processes. They use a variety of tools ranging from application security testing solutions to collaboration platforms like Jira or GitHub for issue tracking and documentation. In their role, they might also facilitate workshops or classes aimed at enhancing developers’ security skills.

### Pathways to Becoming a Security Champion

To become a Security Champion, one typically starts as a developer with a keen interest in security. Familiarity with the software development process provides a strong foundation. A developer who demonstrates a passion for security can take on additional responsibilities related to application security, potentially even volunteering as a security point of contact within their team.

Growth as a Security Champion often involves taking on more complex security tasks, such as conducting internal security assessments or leading initiatives to integrate security tools into the CI/CD pipeline. Experienced Security Champions may move into more formal security roles, such as Application Security Engineers, where they take on broader responsibilities across multiple teams.

### Growth and Leadership Trajectories

As Security Champions gain experience, they may choose to specialize further in areas such as secure architecture design or advanced threat modeling. Opportunities for leadership exist as well, such as leading a Security Champion network across an organization to harmonize security strategies or transitioning into security management roles that oversee an organization’s application security program.

Security Champions are pivotal in facilitating a culture of security awareness and resilience within software development teams, ensuring that security isn't an afterthought but an integral part of the development lifecycle.
