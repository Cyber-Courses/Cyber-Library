## Application Security Engineer

Aspiring to become an Application Security Engineer means focusing on protecting software applications from security vulnerabilities throughout the entire development lifecycle. This role is critical in ensuring that applications are resilient against cyber threats and function securely once deployed.

Application Security Engineers are expected to have a deep understanding of common vulnerabilities and how they can be mitigated, such as those outlined in the OWASP Top Ten. They must be proficient in various programming languages like Java, Python, or C#, as understanding code is crucial for identifying and resolving security issues. Additionally, knowledge of security testing tools such as SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) is essential. 

Typical day-to-day activities might involve conducting security assessments, collaborating closely with development teams to integrate security practices, and participating in secure code reviews. To start in this field, consider gaining experience in software development and then specialize in security through self-study or relevant coursework.

## Secure Code Reviewer

A Secure Code Reviewer plays a pivotal role in identifying security vulnerabilities at the code level before the application goes live. This preventive measure is crucial, as it allows for the detection and remediation of flaws early in the development cycle, saving time and resources while enhancing security posture.

To excel, Secure Code Reviewers need to possess strong programming skills and an analytical mindset. Familiarity with code analysis techniques and tools such as SonarQube or Checkmarx is beneficial. A solid understanding of secure coding standards, like those provided by OWASP and SANS, is also vital.

Professionals in this role typically work within development teams to review code manually and with automated tools. An entry point into this career might be a position as a software developer, leveraging programming expertise before shifting focus to security reviews.

## Product Security Engineer

Product Security Engineers have a broad responsibility for ensuring that all security aspects of a product are addressed throughout its lifecycle. This role involves collaborating with various departments, including development, operations, and product management, to implement security best practices.

Key skills for this role include threat modeling, application threat surface analysis, and risk assessment. Product Security Engineers must be vigilant about industry standards and compliance requirements specific to their industry, such as PCI-DSS or GDPR, depending on the product’s target market.

They typically work on integrating security into the development process (often referred to as the shift-left approach) and are involved from the product's conception through to its deployment and maintenance. Prior experience as a security analyst or application developer with security knowledge is often needed to transition into this role.

## DevSecOps Engineer

The DevSecOps Engineer role merges development, security, and operations to build security into the DevOps pipeline. This enables continuous security delivery across the CI/CD process, enhancing an organization's ability to respond rapidly to security threats or vulnerabilities.

DevSecOps Engineers must have a strong understanding of automation tools like Jenkins, Ansible, or Docker, and be skilled in scripting languages such as Bash or Python. Expertise in integrating security tools into DevOps workflows—such as container security, vulnerability scanning, and security monitoring tools—is crucial.

Their work environment is dynamic, requiring them to work closely with developers and IT operations staff. This role often evolves from either a DevOps Engineer or a Security Analyst position, with additional focus on security practices and tooling.

## Security Champion

Security Champions are key advocates within development teams who promote secure coding practices and act as a bridge between security and development. This role is essential for fostering a culture of security awareness and accountability.

Security Champions need to be proficient in software development with a keen interest in security. They act as trainers and consultants for their peers in security matters, regularly updating their teams on the latest threats and secure coding techniques.

An effective Security Champion is someone who already has established trust and technical credibility within their team, often evolving from experienced software developers or engineers with a demonstrated interest in security.
