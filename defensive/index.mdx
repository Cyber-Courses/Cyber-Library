# Defensive Cybersecurity

Defensive cybersecurity consists of various strategies and practices designed to protect information systems by anticipating, detecting, and responding to threats. This comprehensive guide explores defensive measures through threat intelligence, security operations, threat hunting, active defense, and proactive access management.

## [Threat Intelligence](defensive/threat_intelligence)

Threat intelligence is crucial for anticipating and understanding potential cyber threats. It involves collecting, processing, and analyzing data about threats and threat actors to improve decision-making and defensive strategies.

### [Threat Data Collection Methods](defensive/threat_intelligence/threat_data_collection_methods/)

Effective threat intelligence begins with the accurate collection of threat data. Methods include Open-source Intelligence (OSINT), commercial threat intelligence feeds, and internal logs. These sources provide valuable data points for identifying threats and offer a basis for deeper analysis.

### [Threat Analysis and Processing](defensive/threat_intelligence/threat_analysis_and_processing/)

Analyzing and processing threat data involves examining the collected data to extract actionable insights. Techniques such as correlation analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning are employed to discern threats and predict potential attack vectors.

### [Strategic Threat Intelligence](defensive/threat_intelligence/strategic_threat_intelligence/)

Strategic threat intelligence focuses on high-level threats and trends impacting an organization's strategy. It provides insights into global campaigns and geopolitical cyber threats, aiding in long-term planning.

### [Tactical Threat Intelligence](defensive/threat_intelligence/tactical_threat_intelligence/)

Tactical threat intelligence provides information on threat actor techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs). This intelligence type helps security teams to understand attackers' methods, enabling proactive defenses.

### [Technical Threat Intelligence](defensive/threat_intelligence/technical_threat_intelligence/)

Technical threat intelligence includes data on specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, URLs, and file hashes. It allows rapid response to known threats by updating security systems with the latest threat signatures.

### [Threat Intelligence Sharing](defensive/threat_intelligence/threat_intelligence_sharing/)

Sharing threat intelligence enhances an organizationâ€™s defensive capabilities by exposing them to a broader range of threat data. Platforms like ISACs and CERTs facilitate this exchange, promoting a collaborative defense.

## [Security Operations and Incident Response](defensive/security_operations_and_incident_response)

Maintaining a robust security posture requires well-structured security operations and effective incident response mechanisms.

### [Security Operations Center (SOC) Structure](defensive/security_operations_and_incident_response/security_operations_center_soc_structure/)

A SOC acts as the hub for an organization's defensive operations, requiring a clear structure and skilled staff. SOCs are responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to threats in real time.

### [Monitoring and Detection](defensive/security_operations_and_incident_response/monitoring_and_detection/)

Continuous monitoring through tools like SIEM systems and EDR solutions is essential for real-time threat detection. Advanced techniques, including behavioral analysis and anomaly detection, help identify potential threats quickly.

### [Incident Identification and Escalation](defensive/security_operations_and_incident_response/incident_identification_and_escalation/)

Identifying and escalating incidents involves validating alerts, assessing impacts, and escalating them according to the incident response plan. Accurate and swift identification allows faster responses, minimizing damage.

### [Incident Containment and Analysis](defensive/security_operations_and_incident_response/incident_containment_and_analysis/)

Once an incident is confirmed, containment measures are deployed to limit its impact. Detailed analysis follows, involving forensic investigations to determine root causes and refine defenses.

### [System Recovery and Restoration](defensive/security_operations_and_incident_response/system_recovery_and_restoration/)

Recovery involves restoring affected systems to normal operations after an incident. This phase ensures data integrity and system availability, and it often relies on backups and redundancy strategies.

### [Post-Incident Review and Continuous Improvement](defensive/security_operations_and_incident_response/post-incident_review_and_continuous_improvement/)

Review and improvement are crucial post-incident steps. Post-mortem analyses help identify gaps in existing processes, enabling enhancements to prevent future incidents.

### [Communication and Collaboration](defensive/security_operations_and_incident_response/communication_and_collaboration/)

Effective communication within and outside the security team is vital. This includes coordinating with stakeholders, maintaining transparency, and collaborating with external partners and law enforcement when necessary.

## [Threat Hunting](defensive/threat_hunting)

Threat hunting proactively searches for threats that evade traditional security measures. It involves identifying unusual activities or behaviors within a network.

### [Hunting Methodologies](defensive/threat_hunting/hunting_methodologies/)

Methodologies for threat hunting often follow a cyclical process: formulate hypotheses based on threat intelligence, search for anomalous activity, and refine strategies based on findings.

### [Data Sources for Hunting](defensive/threat_hunting/data_sources_for_hunting/)

Threat hunters rely on diverse data sources, including network traffic logs, endpoint telemetry, and threat intelligence feeds. These data sources help to paint a comprehensive picture of potential threats.

### [Threat Hunting Tools](defensive/threat_hunting/threat_hunting_tools/)

Tools like EDR platforms and SIEM systems play a crucial role in threat hunting, offering the requisite capabilities to analyze, detect, and manage threats in real time.

### [Continuous Improvement](defensive/threat_hunting/continuous_improvement/)

Continuous improvement in threat hunting entails evaluating effectiveness through metrics and continuously updating strategies to adapt to emerging threats and evolving environments.

## [Active Defense](defensive/active_defense)

Active defense encompasses strategies and techniques designed to engage and deter adversaries preemptively.

### [Deception Technologies](defensive/active_defense/deception_technologies/)

Deception technologies, such as honeypots, mislead attackers into engaging with decoy assets, allowing defenders to observe, analyze, and neutralize threats without compromising critical systems.

### [Moving Target Defense (MTD)](defensive/active_defense/moving_target_defense_mtd/)

MTD techniques involve continuously changing attack surfaces to complicate adversary action. This includes rotating IP addresses, shuffling network nodes, or modifying system configurations dynamically.

### [Dynamic Threat-Based Hardening](defensive/active_defense/dynamic_threat-based_hardening/)

Dynamic hardening involves implementing security measures based on the current threat landscape. This approach adapts defenses quickly to mitigate specific threats.

### [Automated Countermeasures](defensive/active_defense/automated_countermeasures/)

Automation in active defense allows rapid responses to identified threats, deploying countermeasures like quarantining infected endpoints or blocking malicious traffic in real time.

### [Adversary Engagement](defensive/active_defense/adversary_engagement/)

Engagement entails interacting with attackers to gather intelligence and disrupt attack tools and methodologies. It often involves controlled environments where attackers can be observed without risk to actual assets.

### [Threat Emulation and Wargaming](defensive/active_defense/threat_emulation_and_wargaming/)

Threat emulation and wargaming simulate real-world attacks to test and improve defenses. These exercises help identify vulnerabilities and train security teams in incident response under controlled conditions.

## [Proactive Access Management](defensive/proactive_access_management)

Proactive access management reduces security risks by controlling and monitoring user access to organizational resources.

### [Least Privilege Enforcement](defensive/proactive_access_management/least_privilege_enforcement/)

Principle of least privilege ensures users have only the necessary access rights to perform their duties, limiting potential damage from compromised accounts.

### [Just-in-Time (JIT) Access](defensive/proactive_access_management/just-in-time_jit_access/)

JIT access provisions privileges on a temporary basis, reducing the window of opportunity for misuse. This approach minimizes exposure by granting access only when needed and removing it immediately afterward.
