# Configuration Bypass

## Context

In this guide, we delve into the methods for bypassing LaTeX configuration restrictions often employed in web-based LaTeX rendering environments. The objective is to demonstrate how adversaries can exploit these configurations to circumvent security mechanisms. This content assumes that you are familiar with the structure of LaTeX documents, web server configurations, sandboxing mechanisms, and possess an understanding of basic LaTeX injection techniques.

## Theory

### LaTeX Security Restrictions and Configuration Controls

LaTeX rendering environments often impose security restrictions to limit the functionality of LaTeX documents. These restrictions aim to prevent unauthorized code execution and file access that might be initiated through LaTeX commands. In web-based services, configurations play a crucial role in enabling or disabling specific LaTeX features that might be deemed harmful.

One of the core principles in such environments is the use of restricted modes or configuration settings to ensure that potentially dangerous features, like shell command execution, are turned off. Misconfigurations or insufficiently restrictive settings may leave these features exposed to exploitation.

### Mechanisms of Configuration Bypass in LaTeX Environments

Attackers utilize various mechanisms to bypass LaTeX security configurations. The primary method involves injecting specific LaTeX code to override security-related directives in the configuration. This is made possible by flaws in the implementation of LaTeX wrappers, which may not adequately sanitize user inputs or enforce required configuration flags. 

The protocol's weakness lies in its handling of user inputs that can seamlessly transition into command-line arguments for the LaTeX engine, making it vulnerable to bypass attempts.

### Common Bypass Vectors: Shell Escape and Interaction Modes

Shell escape (`-shell-escape`) is a LaTeX feature that allows external command execution. This is typically disabled for security reasons because enabling it could lead to arbitrary command execution on the server. Similarly, interaction modes (`-interaction`) determine how LaTeX handles errors and user prompts, and they can be manipulated to affect exploitability.

Attackers often try to abuse these command-line flags or document-level directives to re-enable shell escape or alter interaction modes, thus bypassing the restrictions intended to protect the execution environment.

## Practice

### Bypassing -shell-escape Restriction via Command-Line Injection

- **Identify Unsafe Input Handling:**
  Ensure there is an opportunity where user input is directly passed to the LaTeX engine without proper sanitization.

- **Payload:**
  ```latex
  \immediate\write18{id}
  ```
  **Purpose:** Test execution of a command like `id`, which lists user identity details to verify if shell escape is inadvertently enabled.

- **Execution Command:**
  ```bash
  pdflatex -shell-escape document.tex
  ```
  **Purpose:** See whether the LaTeX engine accepts the `-shell-escape` flag, signaling a potential bypass.

### Overriding Restricted Interaction Modes

- **Payload:**
  ```latex
  % !TeX program = pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -shell-escape
  ```
  **Purpose:** Attempt to alter the interaction mode by introducing a magic comment that manipulates how LaTeX processes errors and potentially enables shell escape.

- **Execution Command:**
  ```bash
  pdflatex document.tex
  ```
  **Purpose:** Verify whether the engine adheres to the injected flags from the document itself.

### Sandboxing Bypass via Configuration File Manipulation

- **Payload:**
  ```latex
  \input|echo '\write18{uname -a}' > texmf.cnf|
  ```
  **Purpose:** Attempt to exploit improper input handling to modify configuration files, potentially altering the engine's behavior to escape the sandbox environment.

- **Execution Command:**
  ```bash
  pdflatex document.tex
  ```
  **Purpose:** Run the manipulated document and observe changes in the processing environment, indicating a successful sandbox evasion.
