# SQLite Error Based

## Context

This guide focuses on exploiting SQLite error-based SQL injection vulnerabilities to disclose sensitive information contained within a database. To gain the most from this material, users should have foundational knowledge of SQL syntax, understand how database error handling operates, and be familiar with basic SQLite functions. Through error-based SQL injection, attackers can leverage improperly handled SQLite error messages to reveal valuable information about the database structure and the data it contains.

## Theory

### Error Message Analysis in SQLite

Error-based SQL injection exploits database error messages to extract information from the database. When a web application improperly handles an SQLite error, it can inadvertently reveal detailed error messages. These messages may disclose elements such as the database schema, table names, column names, and even data values, which can aid an attacker in crafting more sophisticated attacks.

### CASE Statement Usage

The `CASE` statement in SQL allows for the control flow in queries based on conditional evaluations. This can be particularly useful in error-based SQL injection as it allows an attacker to deliberately trigger errors by evaluating conditions that cause exceptions. By crafting queries that induce errors under certain conditions, attackers can retrieve useful information based on the error outputs.

### Boolean Query Exploitation

Boolean queries in SQL return true or false values, and they can be manipulated for error-based injection purposes. Crafting queries that generate errors when a Boolean condition is true or false can result in the disclosure of information through the database's error messages. This technique leverages the program's conditional logic to provoke informative errors.

### Load Extension Function

The `LOAD_EXTENSION` function in SQLite allows for dynamic loading of extensions, which can be exploited when improperly implemented. This function, although powerful, poses risks if not securely managed. Attackers can exploit this feature to execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive information, highlighting the importance of careful extension management.

### Invalid Type Casting

Forcing data into incompatible types in SQLite can trigger errors, which can be exploited for information disclosure. By deliberately causing type mismatches, attackers can generate error messages that yield details about the data types and table schemas involved in the query.

### Division by Zero Exploitation

Dividing a number by zero in a SQL query causes an error, which is a classic technique for error-based SQL injection. By crafting queries that include a division by zero, it is possible to extract database information through the resulting error messages. This technique is straightforward but effective in revealing underlying database structures.

### Undefined Function Handling

Attempting to call non-existent functions in SQLite results in error messages. Exploiting this aspect can help attackers gain insights into the database's available functions and, indirectly, its structure by observing the patterns in the error responses generated by undefined function calls.

### Incorrect PRAGMA Usage

PRAGMA statements in SQLite are used to control various environmental settings. Misusing these statements can provoke errors, which attackers can exploit to extract information. Deliberately issuing incorrect PRAGMA commands can result in error messages revealing sensitive details about the database's settings and operations.

## Practice

### Exploiting Error Messages with Division by Zero

Triggering a division by zero is a method to extract information using SQLite's error handling. This approach is effective for understanding the schema and accessing sensitive information contained within the database.

```bash
SELECT 1/(SELECT 0);
```

Upon executing this command, you should observe error messages that can reveal details about the database schema.

### Using CASE Statements for Error Induction

CASE statements can be leveraged to control error induction, providing a way to understand data characteristics or validate the existence of tables and data based on error feedback.

```bash
SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) THEN 1 ELSE 1/(SELECT 0) END;
```

This tactic exploits conditional logic to forcibly induce errors and derive database information through observation of resultant error messages.

### Invalid Type Casting for Information Disclosure

By forcing an invalid type cast, attackers can cause errors that reveal the database schema or specific data types used within it.

```bash
SELECT CAST((SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table') AS INTEGER);
```

The execution of this query will result in a type mismatch error, enabling you to gather insights about table names or other schema components.

## Tools

- **SQLite3**
- **sqlmap** 

These tools are instrumental in executing SQLite injection attacks and can streamline the process of exploiting error-based vulnerabilities for extracting sensitive data.
