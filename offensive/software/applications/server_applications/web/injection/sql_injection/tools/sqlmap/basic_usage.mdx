# Basic Usage

## Context

This article provides a detailed guide on the basic usage of sqlmap for SQL injection testing. Sqlmap is a powerful tool used to detect and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. This guide assumes an understanding of HTTP requests and the fundamentals of SQL injection.

## Theory

### URL Parameter Usage

When testing a web application for SQL injection vulnerabilities, it is essential to identify the target URL. Sqlmap provides the `--url` option to specify the vulnerable application endpoint. This is a critical step in focusing the tool on the correct target.

### Parameter Selection

Web applications often consist of numerous parameters that could be susceptible to SQL injection. The `-p` option in sqlmap allows users to specify which parameters to focus on during testing, granting more targeted and effective results.

### User Agent Spoofing

The user-agent string is a crucial part of HTTP requests, often used by applications to tailor responses and by security systems to differentiate between visitors. Sqlmap provides the `--user-agent` parameter to modify the default user-agent string, which can help bypass some defenses.

### Random Agent Usage

To avoid detection by systems flagging static user-agent strings, sqlmap supports the `--random-agent` option. This automatically randomizes the user-agent string with each request, mimicking legitimate browsing behavior.

### Thread Management

Sqlmap allows users to define the number of concurrent threads with the `--threads` option. Increasing the thread count can speed up the testing process but may also increase server load.

### Risk Assessment

The aggressiveness of the SQL injection tests can be controlled via the `--risk` parameter, which ranges from 1 (default) to 3. Higher risk levels increase the likelihood of detecting vulnerabilities but may also increase the risk of application disruptions.

### Level Setting

The depth of testing is guided by the `--level` parameter, also ranging from 1 to 5. A higher level results in more exhaustive testing, which can be beneficial for thorough assessments.

### DBMS Selection

Identifying the target Database Management System (DBMS) type optimizes the injection techniques sqlmap uses. This can be specified using the `--dbms` option (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

### OS Detection

The target's operating system can be specified using the `--os` option, aiding sqlmap in using OS-specific techniques. This information can help enhance the precision of the exploitation.

### Batch Mode

For non-interactive testing, sqlmap's `--batch` option automates prompts typically requiring user confirmation, facilitating smoother scripted or long-running operations.

### Authentication Type

When interacting with applications protected by authentication, the type of authentication can be specified through `--auth-type`. This informs sqlmap of the method to use when sending requests.

### Authentication Credentials

Credentials necessary for authenticated requests can be input using `--auth-cred`. This allows sqlmap to access areas of the web application that require user login.

### Proxy Usage

Sqlmap can route its requests through a specified proxy server using the `--proxy` option, making traffic visible for analysis or routing through a VPN for anonymity.

### Union Character Specification

The `--union-char` option allows specification of an alternative character used in union-based injection queries, useful in scenarios where the common character encounters issues.

### SSL Enforcement

To ensure secure connections, the `--force-ssl` option guarantees that all requests made by sqlmap are over SSL/TLS, even if the target does not explicitly require it.

### Timeout Handling

The `--timeout` parameter sets a maximum waiting period for server responses, useful to prevent indefinite hanging of tests on unresponsive servers.

### Retry Mechanism

If requests fail due to network instability or server errors, sqlmap can retry the request a set number of times specified by the `--retries` option, helping overcome transient issues.

## Practice

### Basic SQL Injection Test with sqlmap

To begin testing a web application for SQL injection vulnerabilities using sqlmap, follow these steps:

- Execute a basic SQL injection test:
  ```bash
  sqlmap --url 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --batch
  ```
  This command initiates scanning of the specified URL with default settings in non-interactive mode.

- Choose a specific parameter to test:
  ```bash
  sqlmap --url 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' -p id --batch
  ```
  Here, only the 'id' parameter is targeted for injection testing.

- Set a custom user-agent string:
  ```bash
  sqlmap --url 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0' --batch
  ```
  This can help bypass user-agent-specific restrictions on some web servers.

- Use a random user-agent string:
  ```bash
  sqlmap --url 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --random-agent --batch
  ```
  Avoid detection by systems flagging static user-agent strings.

- Increase concurrent thread count:
  ```bash
  sqlmap --url 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --threads 5 --batch
  ```
  This can considerably speed up the scanning process.

- Set a higher risk level:
  ```bash
  sqlmap --url 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --risk 3 --batch
  ```
  Increase the intensity of tests conducted on the application.

- Specify a target DBMS:
  ```bash
  sqlmap --url 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --dbms mysql --batch
  ```
  Tailor sqlmap's payloads and techniques based on known DBMS characteristics.

- Force SSL usage:
  ```bash
  sqlmap --url 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --force-ssl --batch
  ```
  This ensures that all requests are encrypted.

- Define timeout for responses:
  ```bash
  sqlmap --url 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --timeout 10 --batch
  ```
  Limits the waiting period for responses to mitigate delays due to server unresponsiveness.

These steps will help identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities using sqlmap, providing insights into the security posture of the target application.
