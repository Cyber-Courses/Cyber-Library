# Installation

## Context

The aim of this guide is to provide clear instructions for installing BBQSQL, a Python-based tool designed for performing SQL Injection attacks. To follow this guide, you should be familiar with managing package dependencies, using virtual environments, and have a foundational understanding of SQL Injection techniques.

## Theory

### BBQSQL Installation Requirements

BBQSQL is a tool written in Python, which means it requires certain dependencies to run properly. Understanding these requirements is essential for a successful installation. The installation involves setting up a Python environment and managing various Python package dependencies to ensure all required libraries are installed and correctly configured.

### Dependency Management for BBQSQL

BBQSQL relies on key Python packages such as `gevent` and `requests`. Managing these dependencies carefully is crucial, as incorrect versions might lead to issues with BBQSQL's functionality. Ensuring the correct versions of these dependencies ensures the tool operates as intended without unforeseen errors.

### Virtual Environment Utilization

Using virtual environments is a best practice when installing Python applications. It allows the isolation of dependencies from your system's global Python environment, preventing potential package conflicts. By setting up BBQSQL in its own virtual environment, you ensure a clean and conflict-free installation, minimizing the risk of compatibility issues with other projects.

## Practice

### Install BBQSQL using pip

To install BBQSQL using `pip`, follow these steps:

- **Create a virtual environment for BBQSQL:**
    
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv bbqsql_env
    ```

- **Activate the virtual environment:**
    
    ```bash
    source bbqsql_env/bin/activate
    ```

- **Install BBQSQL and its dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    pip install bbqsql
    ```

Upon completion, BBQSQL will be installed and ready for configuration and use within this isolated environment.

### Install BBQSQL from Source

If preferred, BBQSQL can also be installed directly from its source code. Follow these steps:

- **Clone the BBQSQL repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Neohapsis/bbqsql.git
    ```

- **Navigate to the BBQSQL directory:**
    
    ```bash
    cd bbqsql
    ```

- **Install dependencies from the requirements file:**
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- **Install BBQSQL from source:**
    
    ```bash
    python setup.py install
    ```

After following these steps, BBQSQL will be installed from the source and ready for use, providing flexibility for any custom needs you might have.

## Tools

- **pip**
- **virtualenv**
- **git**

By following this guide, you can ensure that BBQSQL is installed correctly, whether you choose to use pip or install from the source. This enables you to efficiently use BBQSQL's capabilities for SQL Injection testing.
