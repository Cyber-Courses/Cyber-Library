# Hex Encoding

## Context

This article focuses on utilizing hex encoding to evade Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) in SQL injection scenarios specific to IBM DB2. The reader is expected to have prior knowledge of string encoding, binary strings, hex literals, and general SQL injection techniques. Our goal is to leverage hex encoding as a method of obfuscation, enabling attackers to bypass typical security measures.

## Theory

### Hexadecimal Representation in SQL

Hexadecimal encoding represents binary data in a format that is human-readable using base-16 numbers. Each byte is represented by two hexadecimal digits. This format is widely used in computing for obfuscation and data representation purposes.

The key principle of using hex encoding in SQL injection is its ability to transform queries into formats that a WAF might not recognize as malicious. By encoding SQL commands and keywords as hexadecimal, attackers aim to bypass filters designed to block injection attempts.

### Obfuscation Methods Using Hex Encoding

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are designed to block malicious SQL queries. However, they may not decode or recognize hex-encoded payloads, allowing SQL injection attacks to succeed. 

By encoding critical SQL keywords and strings, attackers can obfuscate their operations, masking them under what the WAF perceives as benign traffic. This vulnerability model suggests a bypass mechanism where the focus is strictly on the encoding pattern rather than on its functional logic.

## Practice

### Hex Encoding for WAF Bypass

The following technique demonstrate how hex encoding can be leveraged to bypass WAFs in an IBM DB2 environment:

- **Hex-Encoding Direct Queries**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = x'61646d696e';
    ```

    Here, the string 'admin' is hex-encoded and represented as `x'61646d696e'`. This form may not be recognized by a WAF as an SQL injection attempt, thus allowing the query to execute without triggering defenses.
