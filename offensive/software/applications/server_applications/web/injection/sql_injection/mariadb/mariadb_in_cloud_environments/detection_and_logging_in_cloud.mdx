# Detection and Logging in Cloud

## Context

The primary objective of this article is to guide readers on how to detect and log SQL injection attempts within MariaDB databases hosted in cloud environments. This assumes that readers have a background in cloud infrastructure, understand database logging practices, and are familiar with SQL injection mechanisms, particularly in the context of MariaDB.

## Theory

### Cloud Logging Mechanisms

Cloud logging refers to the process of capturing and storing logs generated by applications and services in cloud environments. Centralized log management plays a crucial role in effective monitoring and incident response, allowing security teams to detect and analyze security incidents efficiently. Despite its advantages, cloud logging can face challenges such as latency or data retention issues which might affect log availability.

### SQL Injection Detection in Cloud

SQL injection vulnerabilities can be detected by monitoring for anomalous SQL query patterns. Attackers typically inject malicious SQL code into database queries to manipulate them for unauthorized data access or manipulation. Understanding the flow of SQL queries—from application to database—enables the capture and logging of anomalies that could signify an SQL injection attempt.

### Cloud Security Monitoring Tools

Various tools like AWS CloudWatch, GCP Logs Explorer, and Azure Diagnostics are available to help monitor and manage cloud environments. To utilize these tools effectively, it's essential to comprehend their logging and alerting capabilities. Misconfigured logging settings can prevent the detection of SQL injection attempts, making it critical to configure these tools correctly.

## Practice

### Detecting SQL Injection via Cloud Logging

To detect SQL injection attempts in a MariaDB database using AWS CloudWatch, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Log Group in AWS CloudWatch**:
    ```bash
    aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name MariaDB-SQLi-Logs
    ```
    This command sets up a log group in AWS CloudWatch specifically to store MariaDB logs.

2. **Create a Log Stream for SQL Injection Attempts**:
    ```bash
    aws logs create-log-stream --log-group-name MariaDB-SQLi-Logs --log-stream-name SQLi-Attempts
    ```
    This command establishes a log stream within the log group to record SQL injection attempts.

3. **Set up a Metric Filter to Detect SQL Injection Patterns**:
    ```bash
    aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name MariaDB-SQLi-Logs --filter-name SQLi-Detection --filter-pattern '{ $.sql_query = '*UNION*SELECT*' }' --metric-transformations metricName=SQLiDetected,metricNamespace=MariaDB,metricValue=1
    ```
    This metric filter detects specific patterns in logged SQL queries that indicate an SQL injection attempt.

4. **Create an Alarm to Notify When SQL Injection is Detected**:
    ```bash
    aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name SQLiAlarm --metric-name SQLiDetected --namespace MariaDB --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:NotifyMe
    ```
    This command sets up an alarm that triggers a notification if any SQL injection patterns are detected.

The outcome of following these steps is that SQL injection attempts are detected and logged in AWS CloudWatch, allowing for proactive threat response.

### Logging SQL Injection Attempts in GCP

In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), SQL injection attempts can be logged as follows:

1. **Create a Logging Sink to Store Logs**:
    ```bash
    gcloud logging sinks create sqli-detection-sink storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket
    ```
    This command establishes a logging sink to transfer logs into a specified Cloud Storage bucket.

2. **Read Logs for SQL Injection Patterns**:
    ```bash
    gcloud logging read 'resource.type="gce_instance" AND jsonPayload.sql_query:*UNION*SELECT*' --limit 10
    ```
    This command retrieves logs containing SQL queries that match common SQL injection patterns.

Following these steps ensures SQL injection attempts are logged and can be promptly reviewed in GCP Logs Explorer.

### Monitoring SQL Injection in Azure

To monitor SQL injection in Azure, utilize the following commands:

1. **Enable Diagnostic Settings for SQL Security Audit Events**:
    ```bash
    az monitor diagnostic-settings create --resource /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/{server-name} --name 'SQLiDetection' --logs '[{"category": "SQLSecurityAuditEvents", "enabled": true}]'
    ```
    This command enables logging of SQL security audit events which include potential SQL injection attacks.

2. **Create an Alert for SQL Injection Detection**:
    ```bash
    az monitor metrics alert create --name 'SQLiAlert' --resource-group {resource-group} --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/{server-name} --condition 'avg SQLSecurityAuditEvents > 0' --action-group {action-group}
    ```
    An alert is set to trigger notifications whenever SQL injection-related logs are detected.

Through these operations, SQL injection attempts are effectively monitored and alerts are triggered, providing real-time threat intelligence in the Azure environment.
