# Version and Environment Detection

## Context

In this article, we will explore techniques to detect the version and environment specifics of a MariaDB database server through SQL injection. Understanding the version and environment configuration can aid attackers in identifying potential vulnerabilities specific to the version or operating environment of MariaDB. Assumed knowledge includes understanding of database versioning and environment configuration.

## Theory

### MariaDB Version Identification

Identifying the version of MariaDB is crucial in understanding the security posture of a database server. The version number can reveal known vulnerabilities, which can then be exploited by an attacker.

- **Definition**: Retrieving the specific version of MariaDB that is running on a server.
- **Core Principle**: Version information can expose vulnerabilities specific to that particular version of MariaDB.
- **Attack Sequence**: SQL injection can be used to execute queries that reveal the MariaDB version.

### Environment Configuration Detection

Knowing the configuration details about the database environment provides insights that may be valuable during an attack.

- **Definition**: The process of extracting configuration details about the MariaDB server environment.
- **Core Principle**: Detailed environment information can help in crafting more effective attacks and understanding the database's operational parameters.
- **Attack Sequence**: Use SQL injection to extract environment variables and settings to gain further insights.

### SQL Injection for Information Disclosure

SQL injection remains a potent method for unauthorized query execution. Attackers exploit this to disclose sensitive information, such as version data and configuration settings.

- **Vulnerability Model**: SQL injection exploits can lead to unauthorized query execution, disclosing sensitive details of the database.
- **Attack Sequence**: Inject SQL queries to retrieve version information and details about the environment configuration.

## Practice

### MariaDB Version Detection via SQL Injection

Detecting the MariaDB version through SQL injection involves executing specific SQL queries designed to extract versioning details.

- **Steps**:
  - Execute the following query to retrieve the MariaDB server version:
    ```sql
    SELECT VERSION();
    ```
  - Use the below query to get additional version details and comments:
    ```sql
    SELECT @@version_comment;
    ```
  - Identify the operating system on which MariaDB is compiled:
    ```sql
    SELECT @@version_compile_os;
    ```

- **Outcome**: By executing these queries, attackers can gain insight into the specific MariaDB version and its operating system compilation details, allowing them to tailor their attack to the vulnerabilities associated with that particular version.

### Environment Variable Extraction via SQL Injection

Extracting environment configurations can provide details on how the MariaDB server is set up, giving attackers valuable information to refine their attacks.

- **Steps**:
  - List all version-related variables with this query:
    ```sql
    SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%version%';
    ```
  - Determine the location of the data directory using the following:
    ```sql
    SELECT @@datadir;
    ```
  - Retrieve all configuration variables with this command:
    ```sql
    SHOW VARIABLES;
    ```

- **Outcome**: These queries will expose sensitive configuration data, including the data directory and other important environmental variables, which can be leveraged by attackers to understand and exploit the database environment.

## Tools

- **sqlmap**
- **Burp Suite** 

These tools can aid in the automated execution of these SQL injection techniques to enumerate version and environment data.
