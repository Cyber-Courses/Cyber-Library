# Automated Tools and Detection

## Context

The purpose of this guide is to enable offensive operators to leverage automated tools for identifying and exploiting XPath injection vulnerabilities within web applications. To get the most out of this content, a reader should already be familiar with XPath syntax and structure, understand basic web application architecture, and have experience with manual XPath injection techniques and exploitation flows.

## Theory

### Automated XPath Injection Scanning

Automated scanning utilizes specialized tools designed to identify XPath injection points within web applications. These scanners facilitate the process by automating the delivery of payloads, analyzing responses, and reporting discovered vulnerabilities. Typically, the workflow involves selecting a target, injecting various payloads into input fields, analyzing the application's responses, and confirming any vulnerabilities that may exist.

### Detection Logic and Payload Strategies

Automated tools rely on carefully crafted payloads to stimulate errors or induce logical anomalies within XPath queries. Strategies to bypass input filters often include encoding variations, strategically inserted comments, or adjusted whitespace. By monitoring the application's responses to these payloads, automated tools can detect anomalies that indicate successful injection points.

### Tool Capabilities and Limitations

While not every scanning tool is equipped for XPath injection, some require additional configurations, custom payloads, or modules. Detection effectiveness is often influenced by the application's error response behavior and the diversity of payloads employed by the tool. These tools operate on the premise that the web application will behave predictably to standardized input patterns, which can occasionally limit their accuracy in detection.

## Practice

### Automated XPath Injection Scanning with Burp Suite Extension

- **Launch Burp Suite:**
    ```bash
    burpsuite
    ```
    Start Burp Suite to enable web proxy interception and scanning capabilities.

- **Install and Enable the Burp BApp Store XPath Injection Extension:** This adds XPath-specific payloads and detection capabilities to Burp's scanner.

- **Configure Target Scope and Proxy Browser Traffic Through Burp:** This step ensures that only relevant endpoints are targeted for scanning.

- **Run an Active Scan on Identified Input Points:** Automated payloads will be injected, and responses analyzed to detect vulnerabilities.

**Outcome:** Burp Suite will identify potential XPath injection points and provide evidence of vulnerabilities in its scan results.

### XPath Injection Detection with OWASP ZAP Fuzzer

- **Launch OWASP ZAP:**
    ```bash
    zap.sh
    ```
    Start OWASP ZAP for comprehensive web application testing.

- **Identify Input Fields or Parameters for Fuzzing:** Prioritize fields with user-controllable data sent to the server.

- **Use ZAP's Fuzzer with a Custom XPath Injection Payload List:** Execute a variety of XPath payloads to probe for vulnerabilities.

- **Monitor Responses for Error Messages or Logical Anomalies:** These anomalies can reveal possible XPath injection points.

**Outcome:** Manual fuzzing will disclose XPath injection vulnerabilities through meticulous response analysis.

### Automated XPath Injection Exploitation with sqlmap (XPath Mode)

- **Invoke sqlmap:**
    ```bash
    sqlmap -u 'http://target/app?param=1' --technique=XPATH
    ```
    Employ sqlmap with XPath technique enabled for automated exploitation attempts.

- **Review sqlmap's Output:** Examine for discovered XPath injection points and extracted data.

**Outcome:** Sqlmap will attempt to exploit XPath vulnerabilities and extract sensitive information if the application is vulnerable.

### XPath Injection Assessment with XSStrike

- **Run XSStrike:**
    ```bash
    xsstrike --url 'http://target/app?param=1' --fuzzer xpath
    ```
    Execute XSStrike using XPath fuzzing mode on the target URL.

- **Analyze XSStrike's Report:** Evaluate findings for discovered injection points and judge payload effectiveness.

**Outcome:** This assessment provides a comprehensive analysis of XPath injection vectors and the efficacy of various payloads.
