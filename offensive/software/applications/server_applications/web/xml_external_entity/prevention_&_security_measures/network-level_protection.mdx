# Network-Level Protection

## Context 

In this article, we will delve into implementing and validating network-level protections specifically designed to mitigate XML External Entity (XXE) attacks through outbound network controls. To follow this guidance effectively, you should have an understanding of network security fundamentals and the mechanisms of XML External Entity attacks.

## Theory

### Outbound Connection Blocking for XXE Mitigation

Outbound connection blocking plays a crucial role in limiting the exploitation opportunities of XXE vulnerabilities. By restricting server-initiated requests to external or internal resources, attackers find it challenging to leverage XXE to communicate with unauthorized endpoints. Typically, an XXE attack requires the vulnerable server to initiate outbound HTTP, FTP, or DNS requests to an attacker-controlled server. By blocking these outbound connections, the potential impact of an XXE attack can be significantly reduced.

### Egress Filtering and Firewall Rules

Egress filtering is a network security practice that controls the outbound traffic from a network. It ensures that any unauthorized connections initiated by internal hosts are blocked. Without proper egress controls, malicious XXE payloads might succeed in exfiltrating sensitive data or interacting with unauthorized internal services. Firewalls can be configured with rules to restrict outbound traffic based on protocols, ports, or destination addresses, providing a robust defense mechanism against potential XXE exploitation.

### DNS Filtering and Proxy Controls

DNS filtering is an effective method to block the resolution of malicious or unauthorized domains, thus disrupting data exfiltration attempts via DNS often seen in XXE attacks. Proxy servers offer additional control, allowing for the enforcement of outbound request policies and inspecting traffic patterns for irregularities. This layered approach aids in preventing XXE attacks that rely on domain name resolution.

### Network Segmentation and Internal Network Protection

Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller segments or VLANs to isolate critical assets and reduce the attack surface. By restricting server access to only necessary internal resources, the exposure to an XXE attack is minimized. Segmentation limits lateral movement within the network, making it more difficult for attackers to reach sensitive internal systems after compromising a server with an XXE vulnerability.

## Practice

### Block Outbound HTTP/FTP Connections via Firewall

To thwart XXE payloads attempting to reach attacker-controlled endpoints, you can block common outbound traffic types using firewall rules:

```bash
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT
```
- Blocks outbound HTTP traffic from the server.

```bash
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j REJECT
```
- Blocks outbound FTP traffic from the server.

```bash
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j REJECT
```
- Blocks outbound HTTPS traffic from the server.

Implementing these rules ensures that the server cannot make unauthorized outbound connections utilized by XXE payloads.

### Implement DNS Filtering to Block Malicious Resolution

Disrupt XXE exfiltration via DNS by blocking domain resolution:

```bash
echo 'address=/#/127.0.0.1' >> /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```
- Redirects all DNS queries to localhost, effectively blocking external resolution.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```
- Applies the DNS filtering configuration.

By leveraging DNS filtering, you can effectively hinder XXE attacks that exploit DNS for data exfiltration.

### Enforce Proxy Usage and Outbound Request Inspection

To ensure that all outbound HTTP traffic is monitored and controlled:

```bash
export http_proxy=http://proxy.internal:3128
```
- Forces server applications to use a controlled proxy for outbound HTTP.

Configure your proxy to block or alert on suspicious outbound requests such as those to unknown domains. Proxy server logs and rules are instrumental in detecting or preventing XXE-related malicious traffic.

### Segment Network to Restrict Server Access

For effective network segmentation:

- **Place XML-processing servers in a DMZ:** Ensures no direct access to critical internal resources, thus reducing an XXE attack vector.
- **Apply firewall rules:** Allow only necessary traffic between the DMZ and the internal network. This minimizes the likelihood of lateral movement and reconnaissance by attackers.

Implementing network segmentation minimizes the attack surface and protects internal assets from exploitation by isolating vulnerable servers.

## Tools

- **iptables**
- **dnsmasq**
- **Squid Proxy**
- **network segmentation (VLAN/firewall)**

These tools are essential for setting up the network-level protections discussed, ensuring a robust defense against XXE volatility.
