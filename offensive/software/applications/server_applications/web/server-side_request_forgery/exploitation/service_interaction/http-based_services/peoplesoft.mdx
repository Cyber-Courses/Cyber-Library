# PeopleSoft

## Context

This article focuses on exploiting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in PeopleSoft systems to interact with internal HTTP-based services. It assumes knowledge of HTTP protocol fundamentals, web server architecture, and general SSRF attack methodologies.

## Theory

### PeopleSoft SSRF Attack Surface

PeopleSoft is a widely used enterprise application suite that often exposes internal HTTP endpoints vulnerable to SSRF attacks. Certain modules within PeopleSoft accept user-supplied URLs, which can enable attackers to manipulate the server to initiate HTTP requests. This occurs when an attacker submits a crafted URL that causes the PeopleSoft backend to fetch and respond to a resource, potentially allowing access to internal services.

### PeopleSoft Architecture and SSRF Entry Points

In PeopleSoft systems, web and application servers are typically situated on segmented networks that have direct access to sensitive internal services. Insufficient validation of URL parameters, particularly in integration or diagnostic modules, presents an opportunity for exploitation. The backend server assumes that requests originated from legitimate users, leading to undue trust of internal network resources.

### HTTP Service Interaction via SSRF

The flow of an SSRF attack usually follows this sequence: a user input (URL) is provided, then the PeopleSoft server makes an HTTP request to an internal service, and eventually, the response is relayed back to the attacker. The lack of egress filtering allows the PeopleSoft application to contact arbitrary HTTP endpoints.

### Network Segmentation Bypass

With SSRF, attackers can pivot from a PeopleSoft server located in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) into more protected network zones. This involves leveraging SSRF to enumerate, interact with, or even exploit internal HTTP-based services that are otherwise inaccessible from outside the network.

## Practice

### Manual SSRF Exploitation via PeopleSoft Integration Broker

- Identify a module within PeopleSoft, such as the Integration Broker, which accepts user-supplied URLs. Entry points can often be found in diagnostic or integration testing features.
- Craft a payload targeting an internal HTTP service. An example payload could be:

    ```http
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/manager/html
    ```

    This aims at an internal service, like a Tomcat Manager, which is not directly accessible externally.
  
- Submit the crafted URL via the vulnerable parameter in the PeopleSoft web interface.
- Observe the HTTP response. The content or error messages returned by PeopleSoft may confirm access to the internal service, validating the SSRF vulnerability.

### Automated SSRF Scanning and Internal Service Enumeration

- Use automated scripts to deliver SSRF payloads and analyze responses across multiple internal endpoints. Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python peoplesoft_ssrf_enum.py --target https://peoplesoft.example.com --param url --wordlist internal_services.txt
    ```

    This script automates discovery and interaction with accessible internal HTTP services through SSRF.
