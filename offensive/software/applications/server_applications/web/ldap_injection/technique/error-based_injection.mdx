# Error-Based Injection

## Context

The goal of this article is to demonstrate how to exploit LDAP error messages for information extraction via error-based injection. This technique leverages weaknesses in error handling and verbose server responses to gather insights into the internal structure of an LDAP directory. Assumed knowledge includes fundamentals of the LDAP protocol, general LDAP injection concepts, and error handling mechanisms in directory services.

## Theory

### LDAP Error Message Disclosure

Error-based LDAP injection involves using detailed server error messages to uncover insights about the directory’s structure or logic. When an LDAP query is malformed, it can prompt the server to generate specific error responses that may contain information about the schema or directory logic. Applications relaying raw LDAP errors can thus expose sensitive internal details.

### Malformed Filter Exploitation

Malformed filter exploitation involves injecting incorrect or unexpected characters into LDAP filters to provoke error messages. This is typically executed by the attacker submitting crafted inputs, which lead to the construction of an invalid LDAP filter by the application. The server's response to such a filter can then disclose valuable error details. Input validation bypasses are often achieved with special characters like unmatched parentheses or wildcards.

### Information Leakage via Error Responses

In this sequence, an LDAP server error is generated and relayed back to the attacker via the application. Implementation flaws in exception handling can expose stack traces, attribute names, or even filter logic. Additionally, LDAP error codes and debug messages might divulge information about directory structures or valid attributes, serving as a gateway to deeper system vulnerabilities.

## Practice

### Triggering LDAP Syntax Errors for Information Disclosure

- **Identify User Input in LDAP Queries**  
    Locate fields in the application (such as login or search inputs) that interact with the LDAP backend.

- **Payload Injection**  
    ```plaintext
    *) (|(objectClass=*))
    ```
    Inject this malformed filter into the identified field to disrupt query syntax.

- **Execute Command**  
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -d 'username=*) (|(objectClass=*))&password=example' https://target-app/login
    ```
    Use this command to send the payload to the application endpoint.

- **Observe Error Messages**  
    After executing the payload, carefully analyze the application’s response for any detailed LDAP error messages, focusing on information like attribute names and filter structures.

**Outcome:**  
Successful exploitation results in the attacker gaining insight into the LDAP schema, attribute names, or query logic from the detailed error messages.

### Enumerating Attributes via Error Message Analysis

- **Payload Injection**  
    ```plaintext
    (&(uid=*)(unknownAttribute=*))
    ```
    Use this filter to inject into application input targeting non-existent attributes.

- **Execute Command**  
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -d 'username=(&(uid=*)(unknownAttribute=*))&password=example' https://target-app/login
    ```
    Send this crafted request to trigger attribute errors.

- **Analyze Error Messages**  
    Check the server’s response for hints about valid or invalid attributes. Sometimes, the error disclosure might inadvertently reveal correct attribute names or further schema details.

**Outcome:**  
By observing the LDAP error messages, attackers can enumerate valid LDAP attributes or schema elements, gaining a further foothold into the internal workings of the directory service.

## Tools

- **curl**
- **Burp Suite** 

These tools can be utilized for crafting requests, observing responses, and performing the necessary injections to explore LDAP error-based vulnerabilities.
