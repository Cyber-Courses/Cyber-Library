# Premium Feature Exploitation

## Context

The objective of this article is to demonstrate and execute the exploitation of premium features in web applications by abusing business logic flaws. This includes gaining unauthorized access to premium functionalities, accessing such features post-cancellation, and manipulating client-side controls. Readers should have a foundational understanding of web application architecture, HTTP cookies, local storage, Boolean logic, and business logic errors to fully benefit from this content.

## Theory

### Premium Feature Access Control Models

Premium features are restricted functionalities typically reserved for authorized or paying users. Access to these features is usually enforced through server-side checks, session tokens, or client-side flags. Vulnerabilities arise when there is weak or inconsistent enforcement, allowing an attacker to bypass restrictions and gain unauthorized access to premium content.

### Business Logic Flaws in Premium Features

Business logic flaws occur when application workflows fail to enforce the intended access or usage restrictions. Attackers target these logical gaps to obtain or retain undeserved premium access without proper authorization.

### Client-Side Controls and Manipulation

Client-side controls, such as cookies, local storage, or JavaScript variables, may indicate a user's premium status. Relying on these client-side indicators for access control is a common implementation flaw that can lead to tampering and privilege escalation through manipulation.

### Session and State Management Weaknesses

Premium features may remain accessible post-cancellation if session tokens or flags persist without proper invalidation. A vulnerability model arises from the failure to update or invalidate session states, allowing users to continue utilizing premium features they should no longer have access to.

## Practice

### Bypassing Premium Feature via Boolean Parameter Manipulation

- **Identify HTTP requests**: Start by analyzing the network traffic to identify the HTTP requests controlling access to premium features. Look for parameters such as `premiumStatus=true` or similar indicators within the requests.
  
- **Manipulate parameter**: Use the `curl` command to modify the HTTP request parameters, setting the premium flag to `true`:

  ```bash
  curl -b 'session=YOURSESSION' -d 'premiumStatus=true' https://target-app.com/api/feature
  ```

- **Test access**: Refresh the application or re-invoke the premium feature to check if it is now enabled.

- **Outcome**: Premium features are unlocked through local storage tampering.

### Post-Cancellation Premium Access via Session Persistence

- **Simulate cancellation**: Initially subscribe to a premium service, then proceed to cancel or downgrade the account.

- **Test session persistence**: Without logging out or clearing cookies, attempt to access premium features using the existing session to determine if premium status is retained.

- **Outcome**: Continual access to premium features post-cancellation due to flaws in session state management is achieved.
