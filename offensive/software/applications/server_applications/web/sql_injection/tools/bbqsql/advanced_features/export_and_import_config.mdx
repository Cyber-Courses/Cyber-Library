# Export and Import Config

## Context

In the dynamic realm of offensive cybersecurity, the ability to efficiently manage and resume SQL injection attacks is crucial. This guide focuses on using BBQSQL's export and import configuration features, which offer a systematic way to manage attack settings. The assumed proficiency includes knowledge of configuration files, data serialization formats like YAML and JSON, and experience with SQL injection techniques.

## Theory

### Configuration Management in BBQSQL

Configuration management is a pivotal concept in using advanced tools like BBQSQL. This process allows you to save and load tool settings, enabling you to pause and resume your offensive operations effectively. By managing configurations, attackers can quickly adapt and redeploy their strategies without redundancy, ensuring a streamlined process across multiple sessions.

### Data Serialization Formats

Understanding data serialization formats is essential when dealing with configuration files. Formats such as YAML and JSON are used to store structured data in a human-readable manner. These formats are widely supported and allow seamless sharing of configurations across different platforms and tools.

### Exporting Configuration

Exporting configuration in BBQSQL involves capturing the current settings of the tool and saving them to a file. This process is critical for preserving attack parameters across different sessions, ensuring that once a configuration is defined, it can be reused without having to re-enter settings manually.

### Importing Configuration

Conversely, importing configuration enables you to load previously defined settings into BBQSQL, effectively allowing you to resume or replicate attacks precisely. This functionality not only saves time but also facilitates consistent execution of attacks across various environments, making the attack process more efficient and effective.

## Practice

### Export BBQSQL Configuration

To save your current settings in BBQSQL and create a backup for future use, follow these steps:

- Open your terminal and use the following command to export settings to a YAML file:

  ```bash
  bbqsql --export-config config.yaml
  ```

- By executing this, you will store the current configuration, ensuring that your settings are preserved for subsequent sessions or deployments.

### Import BBQSQL Configuration

To resume an attack or replicate the configuration settings in a different environment, you can import previously saved settings with the following steps:

- Open your terminal and utilize the command below to load settings from a YAML configuration file:

  ```bash
  bbqsql --import-config config.yaml
  ```

- This command will retrieve your saved settings, allowing you to continue your operations seamlessly from where you left off.

## Tools

- **BBQSQL**: A powerful tool to automate SQL injection attacks, leveraging configuration management to enhance its efficiency. By utilizing BBQSQLâ€™s export and import features, configurations can be adeptly managed to facilitate streamlined and repeatable attack processes.
