# Custom Hooks

## Context

The objective of this article is to teach how to implement and utilize custom hooks in BBQSQL for advanced SQL injection testing. This guide assumes you have knowledge of the HTTP request-response cycle, Python scripting, and the basics of SQL injection. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to integrate custom hooks into BBQSQL, allowing you to modify and analyze requests and responses for complex SQL injection scenarios.

## Theory

### Custom Hooks in BBQSQL

Custom hooks in BBQSQL provide a mechanism for modifying the handling of HTTP requests and responses. These hooks enable you to implement pre- and post-processing logic, empowering you to exploit complex SQL injection scenarios effectively. By integrating custom code, you can tailor the request and response process to meet specific exploitation goals.

### Pre-Request and Post-Request Hooks

Pre-request hooks in BBQSQL allow you to modify HTTP requests before they are sent to the target. This can involve altering headers, parameters, or any other aspect of the HTTP request. Post-request hooks enable you to process and analyze the responses immediately after they are received. The typical attack sequence involves modifying the request parameters, sending the request, and then processing the response to detect potential vulnerabilities.

### Response Handling and Parsing

Response hooks focus on parsing and analyzing HTTP responses to identify SQL injection results. Effective parsing logic is crucial for accurate determination of vulnerabilities, as incorrect parsing can lead to false positives or negatives. Properly implemented response handling ensures that you can accurately identify potential security flaws in the target application.

### Custom Logic in Hooks

Custom logic in the `hooks.py` file allows for tailored handling of both requests and responses. This logic should align with your specific SQL injection goals. Typically, the process involves defining your custom logic within the hooks file, integrating it with BBQSQL, and executing tests to refine and achieve your desired outcomes.

## Practice

### Implementing Pre-Request Hook

To implement a pre-request hook in BBQSQL, follow these steps:

- Open the `hooks.py` file in the BBQSQL directory, which is where you define your custom hooks.
- Insert the following script to modify request parameters:

    ```python
    def pre_request_hook(args):
        # Modify request parameters
        args['headers']['User-Agent'] = 'CustomAgent'
        return args
    ```

    This script changes the `User-Agent` header of the HTTP request to a custom value before the request is sent.

- Execute BBQSQL with the custom pre-request hook using the command:

    ```bash
    python bbqsql.py --hook pre_request_hook
    ```

By applying these instructions, custom HTTP headers are attached to each request, which can be critical for bypassing certain security measures or simulating different user scenarios.

### Implementing Post-Request Hook

For a post-request hook, proceed with these steps:

- Open the `hooks.py` file in the BBQSQL directory.
- Utilize the following script to analyze the response content:

    ```python
    def post_request_hook(response):
        # Analyze response content
        if 'error' in response.text:
            print('Potential SQL Injection vulnerability detected')
    ```

    This script checks the response text for the word "error," which may indicate a potential SQL Injection vulnerability.

- Run BBQSQL with the custom post-request hook using the command:

    ```bash
    python bbqsql.py --hook post_request_hook
    ```

Through this process, you can identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities based on response analysis, enabling a more tailored exploitation strategy.
