# Crawling & Auto-Exploit

## Context

In this article, we explore how to use sqlmap for automated crawling and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities. This guide assumes that you understand basic web crawling, HTTP requests, and SQL injection fundamentals.

## Theory

### Crawl Automation with Sqlmap

Crawl automation is an integral feature of sqlmap that enables users to systematically explore web applications to discover URLs and forms that might be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. By automating this process, sqlmap effectively identifies potential injection points without manual input.

### Form Interaction and Exploitation

Automated form submission is a critical technique for detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities. Sqlmap helps automate this process by identifying forms within web applications, submitting SQL payloads on behalf of the user, and analyzing the responses for signs of vulnerabilities. This sequence allows practitioners to assess the security of web application forms efficiently.

### Risk Assessment in Automated Crawling

Automated crawling inherently carries the risk of impacting the target web application. It is crucial to balance the level of crawl depth with the potential impact on the target. Higher levels of risk increase the likelihood of detecting vulnerabilities but also elevate the chance of detection by the target system's defensive mechanisms.

### Crawl Depth Management

The concept of crawl depth management involves controlling the extent of automated exploration within a web application. This depth is gauged by the number of links followed from the initial URL. Managing crawl depth is essential to optimize time and resources while ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential attack surfaces.

### Batch Processing in Sqlmap

Sqlmap's batch processing feature allows users to automate multiple tests consecutively without constant user interaction. Batch mode streamlines the testing process by responding to prompts with default answers, enabling a smoother and faster vulnerability assessment workflow.

### Exclusion Criteria in Crawling

Exclusion criteria are employed to fine-tune crawling operations, allowing users to exclude specific patterns or URLs from exploration. This avoids unnecessary load on the server and focuses the assessment on relevant parts of the application, thereby optimizing resource allocation and time.

### Crawl Only Mode

Crawl-only mode is a specific operational setting in sqlmap where the tool maps the structure of the web application without performing any injection tests. This mode is particularly beneficial for understanding the layout and organization of the application's resources before proceeding with a full exploitation attempt.

## Practice

### Automated Crawling and Exploitation with Sqlmap

The following steps demonstrate how to use sqlmap for automated crawling and exploitation:

1. **Initiate Crawling with Depth 2 and Automated Exploitation:**

    ```bash
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com" --crawl=2 --batch
    ```

2. **Target Forms for SQL Injection Testing:**

    ```bash
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com" --forms --batch
    ```

3. **Exclude URLs Containing 'logout' from the Crawl:**

    ```bash
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com" --crawl-exclude="logout" --batch
    ```

4. **Perform Crawling Without Exploitation to Map the Site:**

    ```bash
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com" --crawl-only --batch
    ```

Executing these commands will enable sqlmap to identify and exploit SQL injection points automatically, providing a thorough vulnerability assessment of the target web application.
