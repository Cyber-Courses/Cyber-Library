# Detect Columns Number

## Context

The focus of this article is to teach how to determine the number of columns in a MySQL table using UNION-based SQL injection. The reader should have a good understanding of SQL syntax, HTTP requests, database schema concepts, and be familiar with the basics of MySQL UNION-based injection techniques.

## Theory

### Union Injection Basics

Union injection is an SQL injection technique that allows an attacker to combine the results of multiple SELECT statements. For a UNION injection to work, the number and data types of columns in the SELECT statements must match.

### Determining Column Count

To determine the correct number of columns for a successful UNION injection, two primary methods are used: the Null method and the Order By method.

#### Null Method

This method involves using NULL values in a UNION SELECT statement. NULLs can bypass data type constraints, enabling cross-comparison of different data types without errors. Increment the number of NULLs used in the UNION SELECT statement until no error is returned.

#### Order By Method

The Order By method involves incrementally increasing the ORDER BY clause number until an error is encountered. The highest working number before the error indicates the correct number of columns.

## Practice

### Determine Column Count with UNION Injection

Using the UNION injection method to find the correct number of columns involves step-by-step testing with NULL values in a UNION SELECT statement.

- Identify an injectable parameter by performing basic SQL injection tests.
- Start with a single NULL in the UNION SELECT to check if the injection is working.

```http
http://example.com/page?id=1' UNION SELECT NULL--
```

- If no error occurs, increment the number of NULLs until you find the correct column count.

```http
http://example.com/page?id=1' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
```

- Continue this process, adding more NULLs, until you find the exact number where no errors are returned.

### Determine Column Count with ORDER BY

This technique uses the ORDER BY clause to reveal the number of columns.

- Start by identifying an injectable parameter with basic SQL injection tests.
- Use ORDER BY with a starting number of 1 to test the column order.

```http
http://example.com/page?id=1 ORDER BY 1--
```

- Increment the ORDER BY number step by step until an error is triggered.

```http
http://example.com/page?id=1 ORDER BY 2--
```

- Continue this process until an error occurs, which means you have attempted to order by more columns than exist. The highest working number before the error indicates the column count.
