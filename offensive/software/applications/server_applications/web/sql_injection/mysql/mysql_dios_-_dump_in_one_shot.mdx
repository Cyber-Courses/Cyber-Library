# MYSQL DIOS - Dump in One Shot

## Context

This article explores the MYSQL DIOS (Dump in One Shot) technique used in SQL injection attacks to extract large volumes of data from a database in a single query execution. This method is particularly useful when attackers aim to dump entire tables or significant data columns efficiently. The technique leverages certain features of the SQL language, specifically MYSQL, to concatenate and retrieve data in one go. Understanding SQL queries and the database schema is assumed.

## Theory

### MYSQL DIOS Attack Fundamentals

MYSQL DIOS, short for "Dump in One Shot," is a powerful SQL injection technique designed to extract extensive data sets from a database within a single query execution. This method is incredibly efficient for attackers seeking to maximize data extraction with minimal interaction. The core principle involves the use of SQL functions like `GROUP_CONCAT` to aggregate and return large amounts of data as a single output. This attack exploits vulnerabilities in web applications where there is insufficient input validation, allowing malicious SQL queries to concatenate and extract data from multiple rows of a database table.

### GROUP_CONCAT Function in MYSQL

The `GROUP_CONCAT` function in MYSQL is pivotal to the DIOS technique. It allows the concatenation of values from multiple database rows into a single, string-formatted output. During an attack, `GROUP_CONCAT` can be injected into a vulnerable SQL query to gather and output data from various rows, all in one shot. This is particularly dangerous in contexts where the application's input fields can be manipulated to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

### Limitations and Considerations

While the MYSQL DIOS technique is highly effective, it does require specific preconditions for success. The attacker needs knowledge of the target database schema, as constructing effective injection queries depends on this understanding. Additionally, the length of the result set returned by `GROUP_CONCAT` is limited, which imposes a constraint on the amount of data that can be extracted in one query. Properly crafted queries are essential to bypass these limitations.

## Practice

### MYSQL DIOS - Dump in One Shot

To perform a MYSQL DIOS attack, follow these steps:

- Identify a vulnerable parameter in the web application. Look for inputs that are not sufficiently sanitized and can be used to execute SQL queries.
  
- Craft a query using `GROUP_CONCAT` to concatenate and extract data. Here's an injected SQL command example:

  ```bash
  SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(username, 0x3a, password) FROM users;
  ```

  - Replace `username` and `password` with actual column names from the target table.
  - The `0x3a` is a hexadecimal representation of a colon (`:`) used to separate concatenated fields for clarity.

- Execute the query against the vulnerable parameter. Ensure that `column_name`, `table_name`, and any conditions reflect the true schema of the database you aim to extract from.

- Here's an example of a full SQL payload that might be injected:

  ```sql
  SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  ```

#### Result

Executing this technique will extract and concatenate data from multiple rows, providing the attacker with potentially sensitive data, such as user credentials, in a single output.
