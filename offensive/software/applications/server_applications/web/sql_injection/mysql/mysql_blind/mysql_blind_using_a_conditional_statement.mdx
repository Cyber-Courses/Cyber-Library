# MYSQL Blind Using A Conditional Statement

## Context

In this article, we will explore how to exploit MySQL blind SQL injection vulnerabilities using conditional statements. This technique involves crafting SQL queries that evaluate conditions and manipulate application responses to infer sensitive data. A strong understanding of SQL syntax, conditional statements, boolean logic, and prior knowledge of MySQL blind injection techniques is assumed.

## Theory

### Conditional Statements in SQL

Conditional statements play a crucial role in SQL queries by providing the means to evaluate expressions and return true or false results. These results can dictate the query's flow, allowing for more dynamic and context-driven behavior. In a blind SQL injection context, these statements can be leveraged to infer information about the database indirectly, guiding the attacker's path to accessing unauthorized data.

### Blind SQL Injection

Blind SQL injection refers to a scenario where the attacker can discern data not through direct retrieval but by observing changes in the application's behavior or response time. Instead of producing data visibly, a blind SQL Injection adapts the query to provide conditions that, when satisfied, lead to discernible actions, like time delays. This information can then be systematically exploited to gather critical details about the database structure and its contents.

### Using IF() in MySQL

The `IF()` function in MySQL allows for conditional logic processing within the database. 

```sql
IF(condition, true_result, false_result)
```

When exploited, this function can cause conditional delays or errors based on the truth value of the condition. For instance, by embedding sleep functions within an IF statement, attackers can force an application to delay responses, confirming the truth of tested conditions. This ability to manipulate response times is a potent tool for extracting vital database information in a blind SQL injection attack.

## Practice

### MySQL Blind SQL Injection Using Conditional Statements

To exploit MySQL blind SQL injection vulnerabilities using conditional statements, follow these steps:

- **Identify a vulnerable input field**:
  - Start by finding an input field on a web application that directly interacts with the database using SQL queries. This could be a URL parameter, form input, or anywhere user input is integrated into backend SQL logic.

- **Inject a time-based payload**:
  - Confirm the siteâ€™s vulnerability by injecting a simple conditional SQL statement that includes a time delay. This will help ensure the attack is feasible by triggering a notable delay when the condition is true.
  ```bash
  http://example.com/item?id=1' AND IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)-- -
  ```

- **Observe the behavior**:
  - If the site is vulnerable, the above request should take longer to respond when the condition is true (1=1). A normal response time or a quick return would suggest that the false branch (where Sleep is not called) executed.

- **Craft conditional logic for data extraction**:
  - Utilize conditional statements to extract information, such as database version or name, one bit at a time by applying time delay logic to inference-based questions:
  ```bash
  http://example.com/item?id=1' AND IF(ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT database()),1,1))=100, SLEEP(5), 0)-- -
  ```
  - By comparing the response time against expected delays, determine whether the condition (e.g., `database() = 'target_db'`) is true, slowly revealing the desired database name.

- **Iterate for complete information**:
  - Continue this process iteratively, modifying the condition's logic to peel away new layers or specific entities of the database structure and contents you aim to uncover.

**Result**: By employing conditional delay tactics, you can systematically extract sensitive database information from applications vulnerable to MySQL blind SQL injections. This method allows asset discovery without explicit output from the database being visible.
