# Offensive Cybersecurity

## Network Attacks

### Intermediate Network Penetration Techniques
Intermediate network penetration involves the exploitation of vulnerabilities within a network to gain unauthorized access. Techniques include utilizing publicly available exploits, crafting custom payloads, and conducting Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Tools like Metasploit can automate these attacks, providing modules to exploit various known vulnerabilities. Familiarity with [network scanning](offensive/Scanning/) and [enumeration](offensive/Enumeration/) is essential for penetration testing and to determine the attack surface.

### Advanced Network Pivoting and Lateral Movement
Pivoting refers to using a compromised system to attack other systems within the same network. This requires the ability to execute code across multiple platforms and maintain connectivity with the compromised hosts. Tools like SSH tunnels and proxychains facilitate network pivoting by forwarding or redirection of traffic through compromised hosts. [Lateral movement](offensive/Lateral Movement/) strategies often involve exploiting weak passwords and leveraging native network administration tools.

### Advanced Network Scanning and Enumeration
Advanced network scanning uses stealth techniques to avoid detection and comprehensive enumeration to identify all assets and services within a network. Tools like Nmap offer stealth scan options (e.g., SYN scan), while more sophisticated enumeration scripts and custom scans provide deeper insight into network vulnerabilities. Engaging with [initial access techniques](offensive/Initial Access Techniques/) can provide reconnaissance for further targeted attacks.

### Exploiting Network Protocols
Exploitation of network protocols involves taking advantage of weaknesses in communication standards or improperly implemented protocol features. Protocols such as HTTP, SMB, and SNMP often have specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Common techniques include sniffing unencrypted data, cache poisoning, and exploiting authentication flaws. Understanding [exploitation techniques](offensive/Exploitation/) will aid in identifying opportunities for manipulation.

### Network Backdoors and Persistence
Backdoors facilitate unauthorized access by bypassing standard authentication methods. These can be installed during exploitation using payloads that create new user accounts or adjust firewall rules. Persistence involves maintaining access to a compromised network over a long period, often achieved by setting up cron jobs, creating scheduled tasks, or through [post exploitation](offensive/Post Exploitation/) setups that refresh the backdoor automatically.

## Web Application Attacks

### Advanced Injection Techniques
Injection attacks involve inserting malicious code into a web application through input fields or URL parameters. Techniques like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) can manipulate backend databases or inject malicious scripts into webpages. Tools such as SQLmap automate these attacks by performing a series of payloads to extract data or take control of the database. Familiarity with specific [server-side vulnerabilities](offensive/Server-Side Vulnerabilities/) is crucial in developing effective injection attacks.

### Exploiting Business Logic Vulnerabilities
Business logic vulnerabilities arise from flaws in the application's workflow, allowing attackers to manipulate processes to their advantage. Examples include bypassing payment systems or exploiting coupon codes. Analyzing [client-side](offensive/Client-Side Vulnerabilities/) and [framework-specific vulnerabilities](offensive/Framework-Specific Vulnerabilities/) provides a complete understanding of possible business logic handling flaws.

### Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
SSTI exploits vulnerabilities within server-side templates, enabling attackers to inject code into templates before they are rendered. By injecting payloads that exploit template parsing features, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server. This attack builds upon [multi-stage attacks and chained exploits](offensive/Chained Exploits and Multi-Stage Attacks/), using access gained from SSTI for deeper intrusion.

### Web Application Exploitation Automation
Automated tools like Burp Suite work by intercepting and manipulating web traffic to uncover vulnerabilities. These tools can automate tasks such as scanning, intrusion attempts, and exploit crafting, greatly enhancing efficiency. Automation of web attacks relies on detailed mapping and understanding of all potential [vulnerabilities](offensive/Web Application).

### Advanced Web Shell Deployment
Web shells provide attackers with a remote shell on a compromised web server, enabling them to execute commands, upload files, and interact with other services. Sophistication in web shell deployment includes encryption of communications and embedding within legitimate files, making detection challenging. To ensure persistent access, integrate [persistence techniques](offensive/Persistence Techniques/) alongside the shell.
