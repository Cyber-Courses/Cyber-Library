### Network Attacks

#### Intermediate Network Penetration Testing Techniques

[Network](/offensive/network/) penetration testing involves identifying vulnerabilities in a network's configuration and architecture. Effective techniques start with network scanning and enumeration using tools like Nmap and Zenmap. These tools facilitate the discovery of active devices within a network, open ports, and associated services.

Example Command:
```bash
nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.0/24
```
This command performs service version detection, operating system detection, and runs scripts against the specified network range with increased speed for quicker results.

Service-specific exploitation focuses on vulnerabilities associated with particular protocols or applications, such as DNS or HTTP. Understanding the nuances of each protocol reveals potential attack vectors unique to each service, allowing for targeted exploitation.

#### Advanced Network Infrastructure Attacks

Advanced techniques require understanding network topology and the ability to pivot within a network post-compromise. Pivoting can be achieved using tools like SSH tunneling or Metasploit's socks proxy module. This enables access to network segments otherwise inaccessible.

Network traffic manipulation involves intercepting and altering data as it traverses the network. For this, tools like Wireshark for packet analysis and Ettercap for packet injection and manipulation are essential.

Example Command with Metasploit:
```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.1
set USERNAME admin
set PASSWORD admin
run
```
This command attempts to login to SSH services using specified credentials across the provided network address.

#### Post-Exploitation Network Techniques

After gaining initial access, maintaining persistence is crucial. Techniques range from creating redundant access backdoors to exploiting scheduled tasks. Understanding domain-specific operations in a compromised environment helps in achieving stealthy persistence.

Data exfiltration strategies often employ legitimate protocols to bypass detection. Encrypting outbound traffic or using HTTP/S, DNS tunneling, or crafted packets can help in exfiltrating data while evading network monitoring.

### Web Application Attacks

#### Intermediate Web Exploitation Techniques

SQL Injection remains a prominent threat, affecting web applications using a relational database. Mastery involves detecting vulnerable inputs and crafting payloads to manipulate database behavior or extract data.

Example Command with SQLMap:
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/item?id=1" --dbs
```
This automates SQL injection testing on a given URL, aiming to enumerate databases.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to inject malicious scripts executed in a user’s browser, targeting both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities.

#### Advanced Web Application Penetration

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks trick a server into processing unsanitized URLs, potentially leading to unauthorized access and information leakage. Exploiting business logic flaws requires understanding the application’s workflows and manipulating them to gain unauthorized actions, like privilege escalation.

Client-side attacks against Single Page Applications (SPAs), using a heavy JavaScript architecture, can expose API interactions or routing flaws. Thoroughly analyzing these interactions uncovers potential attack vectors.

#### Client-Side and Web Services Attacks

APIs are integral to web applications, providing a direct link to backend services. API exploitation involves bypassing authentication, injecting malicious data, or abusing endpoints leveraging vulnerable logic or data flows.

---

### Mobile Application Attacks

#### Intermediate Mobile Penetration Testing

Reverse engineering mobile applications with tools like ApkTool for Android or Hopper for iOS allows penetration testers to understand application behavior and discover vulnerabilities within the code, especially those dealing with data storage.

Example Command:
```bash
apktool d -f MyApp.apk
```
This command decompiles an APK file to review and analyze the contents statically.

Data storage attacks focus on exploiting insecure handling of sensitive information on devices, such as extracting data from internal storage using forensic tools.

#### Advanced Mobile Security Exploitation

Advanced exploitation techniques target mobile operating systems' inherent vulnerabilities. For Android and iOS, rooting or jailbreaking might be necessary to execute certain types of exploits.

Mobile network protocol attacks often aim at manipulating or intercepting traffic sent over insecure communication protocols or exploiting weak cryptographic implementations.

---

### CI/CD Pipeline Attacks

#### CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerability Discovery

Identifying CI/CD pipeline vulnerabilities often starts with evaluating the configuration of CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitLab-CI. Misconfigurations or excessive permissions can create security gaps.

Exploit strategies involve injecting malicious code into build jobs or manipulating artifact repositories to introduce backdoors into the software distribution process.

Advanced CI/CD exploitation techniques leverage these access points to further propagate through the development lifecycle, exploiting orchestration systems and automation scripts for deeper compromise.

---

### Cloud Security Attacks

#### Intermediate Cloud Service Exploitation

Cloud environments, such as AWS or Azure, often present unique security challenges. IAM roles and policies are a frequent target due to their role in controlling access. Misconfigured roles can be exploited to gain unnecessary privileges.

Cloud storage exploiting involves identifying publicly accessible buckets or using misconfigured access policies to access sensitive data.

#### Advanced Cloud Exploitation Techniques

Serverless functions, often used for executing stateless microservices, can be vulnerable to code injection or permission exploitation. Cross-cloud pivoting refers to compromising interconnected services across multiple cloud platforms, further extending attack reach and data access.

---

### Container Security Attacks

#### Container Environment Vulnerability Identification

Scanning container images with tools like Clair or Trivy identifies vulnerabilities present in the software packages and configurations.

Advanced exploitation of container environments might involve escaping the container to execute code on the host system, using Kubernetes vulnerabilities to exploit clusters, or leveraging unpatched container runtimes.

---

### API Security Attacks

#### Intermediate API Exploitation Techniques

APIs can be susceptible to attacks like authentication bypass due to poorly implemented security controls. Using tools like Postman or Burp Suite allows systematic testing of API endpoints.

API injections, such as command injection or JSON Web Token attacks, target flawed parsing or logic processes.

Advanced API security testing uncovers potential overwrites or abuse cases involving the orchestration of microservices, where complex interdependencies might introduce unique vulnerabilities.

---

### Hardware Attacks

#### Hardware Exploitation Foundation

Hardware attacks often start by reverse engineering firmware using tools like binwalk, focusing on understanding the boot process and firmware structure.

Advanced techniques, including side-channel attacks, exploit unintended information leaks from power consumption or electromagnetic emissions. Chip-level exploitations require specialized tools and in-depth knowledge to manipulate hardware directly.

---

### Wireless Network Attacks

#### Intermediate Wireless Penetration Testing

Wireless networks are often targeted through encryption-breaking attacks using tools like Aircrack-ng to capture and analyze handshake traffic.

Example Command:
```bash
aircrack-ng -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w wordlist.txt capturefile.cap
```
This attempts to crack a WPA/WPA2 key using a captured handshake and a wordlist.

Advanced wireless attacks can proliferate into mesh networks or exploit Bluetooth-enabled devices using protocol-specific flaws.

---

### Physical Security Attacks

#### Physical Access and Security Bypass Techniques

Physical security attacks often involve bypassing access controls like locks or attempting to clone smart cards using devices such as Proxmark3.

Facility penetration achieves a breach by exploiting RFID vulnerabilities or bypassing security systems using tailgating or social engineering tactics to gain physical access.

---

### Cryptographic Attacks

#### Identifying Cryptographic Vulnerabilities

Cryptographic attacks involve exploiting implementations of protocols rather than the algorithms themselves. Weak cryptographic implementations can often be detected using static and dynamic analysis methods.

Advanced cryptanalysis may involve techniques like collision attacks or exploiting weaknesses in key exchange protocols to derive plaintext information from supposedly secure communications.

---

### Exploit Development

#### Intermediate Exploit Creation Techniques

Exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities forms the basis of primitive exploit development. Crafting shellcode to execute arbitrary code following an overflow is essential for further exploitation.

Advanced techniques involve complex mechanisms like Return Oriented Programming (ROP) chains to bypass modern security protections, culminating in crafting specific kernel-level exploits.

---

### Red Teaming

#### Planning and Executing Red Team Engagements

The cornerstone of red teaming is in-depth scenario development and reconnaissance to simulate realistic threat actors. These exercises require understanding internal workflows and potential vectors of attack.

Advanced operations extend to full-scope engagements simulating nation-state level threats, incorporating tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to evaluate organizational resilience comprehensively.

---

### Evasion Techniques

#### Bypassing Defense Mechanisms

Defense evasion involves manipulating or outright bypassing antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Evasion might leverage obfuscated commands or novel techniques like process hollowing to disguise malicious activities.

In advanced evasion, attackers use Living-Off-The-Land Binaries (LoLBins)—legitimate system tools—to hide their activities from security monitoring systems. Developing custom binaries or carefully crafted scripts enables ongoing operations with reduced detection risk.

---

### Malware Development

#### Intermediate Malware Coding

Developing basic malware requires understanding the anatomy of Trojans and backdoors, focusing on persistence and communication channels.

Advanced development encompasses creating polymorphic and metamorphic malware that can alter itself to evade signature-based detection, integrating advanced algorithms for encryption and obfuscation to protect payloads and command channels.
