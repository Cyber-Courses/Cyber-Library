# Offensive Cybersecurity Roadmap

## Network

### Reconnaissance and Network Mapping
Network reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target network to create a map of its structure and devices. Techniques include passive information gathering, scanning, and active enumeration of network components. Tools like Nmap and Wireshark are leveraged to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. Use commands like:

```bash
nmap -sS -O -v target-ip
```

This command performs a TCP SYN scan and detects the target operating system.

### Lateral Movement Strategies
Lateral movement refers to techniques attackers use to pivot through the network after initial access. This includes exploiting vulnerabilities in adjacent network segments and using compromised credentials to access resources. Attackers may utilize tools such as PsExec or PowerShell for lateral propagation.

### Exploiting Network Protocols
This involves identifying weaknesses in network protocols like SMB, RDP, or DNS and leveraging them to execute unauthorized actions. Knowledge of protocol mechanics and anomaly creation can lead to successful exploitation.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack Techniques
MitM attacks involve intercepting and altering the communication between two parties without detection. Techniques may include ARP spoofing or DNS poisoning. Attackers utilize tools like Ettercap and MITMf for capturing and manipulating traffic.

### Network Traffic Analysis and Manipulation
Traffic analysis involves monitoring network data packets to identify patterns or anomalies. Attackers may reroute, drop, or inject packets to disrupt or dissect communications. Tools like Tcpdump and Scapy are commonly used for these purposes.

## Web Application

### Advanced Injection Attacks (SQLi, NoSQLi)
SQL Injection involves inserting malicious SQL code into user input fields to manipulate or extract data from a database. The principle extends to NoSQL databases with NoSQLi. SQLmap is a common tool for automating SQL injection and database takeover:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/search?q=test" --dbs
```

This command attempts to extract database names from the target URL.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and CSRF Exploitation
XSS allows attackers to inject scripts into web pages viewed by other users, enabling session hijacking or data theft. CSRF tricks users into executing unwanted actions on a different site where they are authenticated.

### Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and BOLAs
IDOR vulnerabilities allow attackers to access data by manipulating references to objects (e.g., user IDs). Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLAs) involves improper enforcement of access control over individual objects.

### Web Shell Tactics and Persistence
Install a web shell on a compromised server for persistent access and remote command execution. Web shells are simple scripts that provide an interface via HTTP.

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Example of a simplistic PHP web shell.

### Web Application Firewall Evasion
Evading WAFs involves crafting payloads that bypass signature-based detection. Techniques include encoding, obfuscation, or fragmentation of attack vectors.

## Mobile Application

### Reverse Engineering Mobile Applications
Reverse engineering involves decrypting and analyzing a mobile app's code to understand its logic and identify vulnerabilities. Tools like APKTool or Hopper are essential for disassembly or decompilation.

### Mobile Platform Vulnerability Exploitation
Each mobile platform (e.g., Android, iOS) has specific vulnerabilities. Exploits may involve leveraging system privileges or outdated libraries.

### Intercepting and Manipulating Mobile Communications
Attackers use tools like Burp Suite or Frida to intercept and manipulate data transmitted by mobile applications, especially when SSL/TLS implementations are weak or misconfigured.

### Mobile Application Data Security Breaches
Targeting insecure data storage or data transmission methods used by mobile apps, where sensitive information is stored or communicated without adequate encryption.

## Supply Chain

Compromising the development pipeline can lead to widespread distribution of malicious code. Attackers target source code repositories or CI/CD environments to inject backdoors.

### Embedded Systems Security Testing
Focus on identifying vulnerabilities within firmware or software of embedded devices. Testing often includes hardware interfaces like JTAG or UART.

### Supply Chain Compromise Techniques
Inserting malicious components within a product's supply chain disrupts the integrity before it reaches the end-user. Notable instances include hardware implants or tampered update files.

### Third-Party Software Backdooring
Introducing hidden, unauthorized code into software products supplied by third-party vendors during development, intentional or via exploit.

## CI/CD

### Compromising CI/CD Environments
Unauthorized access to a CI/CD environment grants power to alter the software build process, potentially inserting malicious code before deployment.

### Infiltrating Build Pipelines
Attackers intercept or modify build artifacts, leading to the distribution of compromised software. Vulnerabilities in build scripts or dependencies are commonly exploited.

### Artifact Tampering and Integrity Compromise
Modification of build artifacts undetected can subvert software's intended functionality. Ensuring artifact integrity is crucial, relying on checksums or cryptographic signatures.

### CI/CD Tool Vulnerability Exploitation
Known vulnerabilities in CI/CD tools, such as Jenkins or GitLab, can be exploited for unauthorized access and code alteration.
