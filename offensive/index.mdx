# Offensive Cybersecurity

## Network

The network is a vast battlefield for offensive operations, involving a series of well-orchestrated attack vectors. [Network](/offensive/network) attacks begin with effective reconnaissance and enumeration stages which include [scanning](/offensive/network/scanning/) for open ports and services, and [enumeration](/offensive/network/enumeration/) techniques to gather details about the network infrastructure. The information collected helps determine potential weaknesses that can be exploited for [initial access](/offensive/network/initial_access_techniques/) into target networks.

Once access is obtained, attackers may utilize the [exploitation](/offensive/network/exploitation/) of vulnerabilities found in network services and software to further infiltrate the target environment. After infiltrating, attackers perform [post-exploitation](/offensive/network/post_exploitation/) actions such as privilege escalation to [achieve higher levels of access](/offensive/network/privilege_escalation/) and [lateral movement](/offensive/network/lateral_movement/) within the network. To maintain control and access to compromised systems over time, various [persistence techniques](/offensive/network/persistence_techniques/) are used.

## Web Application

Web application security forms a critical component of modern offense. Offensive techniques start with understanding and exploiting [server-side vulnerabilities](/offensive/web_application/server-side_vulnerabilities/) such as SQL Injection and Remote Code Execution. On the client side, [attacks](/offensive/web_application/client-side_vulnerabilities/) focus on vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Additionally, exploiting [CMS-specific vulnerabilities](/offensive/web_application/cms-specific_vulnerabilities/) allows attackers to breach popular platforms such as WordPress and Joomla. Exploiting [framework-specific vulnerabilities](/offensive/web_application/framework-specific_vulnerabilities/) can bypass underlying security architectures that applications rely on. In advanced web application attacks, attackers often design [chained exploits and multi-stage attacks](/offensive/web_application/chained_exploits_and_multi-stage_attacks/) to escalate their access and impact on target systems.

## Mobile Application

Mobile application vulnerabilities present unique challenges due to platform diversity. Attacks often focus on [platform-specific vulnerabilities](/offensive/mobile_application/platform-specific_vulnerabilities/), affecting only certain devices or operating systems. By exploiting [cross-platform framework vulnerabilities](/offensive/mobile_application/cross-platform_framework_vulnerabilities/), attackers can impact applications that are developed using common frameworks like Xamarin or React Native.

Compromising [data storage](/offensive/mobile_application/data_storage_vulnerabilities/) and [communication](/offensive/mobile_application/communication_vulnerabilities/) components to access sensitive information and intercept communication is vital. Methods to bypass mobile [authentication and authorization](/offensive/mobile_application/authentication_and_authorization_flaws/) safeguards may also be employed. Further exploration of [cryptographic vulnerabilities](/offensive/mobile_application/cryptographic_vulnerabilities/) allows for cracking of encryption systems. The reverse engineering and [code tampering](/offensive/mobile_application/reverse_engineering_and_code_tampering/) of mobile apps provide deep insight into application logic. Lastly, attackers may find ways to exploit [excessive permissions and extraneous functionality](/offensive/mobile_application/excessive_permissions_and_extraneous_functionality/) within applications.

## Supply Chain

Supply chain attacks exploit the trust relationships between vendors and customers. Techniques include [vendor supply chain compromise](/offensive/supply_chain/vendor_supply_chain_compromise/) and [hardware supply chain exploits](/offensive/supply_chain/hardware_supply_chain_exploits/). These tactics enable attackers to introduce malicious elements during the manufacturing or distribution phases, affecting wide-reaching ecosystems.

## CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines might inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities at every stage, including [plan](/offensive/cicd/plan/), [code](/offensive/cicd/code/), [build](/offensive/cicd/build/), [testing](/offensive/cicd/testing/), [release](/offensive/cicd/release/), [deploy](/offensive/cicd/deploy/), [operate](/offensive/cicd/operate/), and [monitor](/offensive/cicd/monitor/). Attackers aim to exploit weaknesses within these processes to inject malicious code or exfiltrate sensitive data.

## Cloud

Cloud environments present a unique set of challenges and opportunities for offensive operations. Attackers exploit specific vulnerabilities within cloud service providers such as [AWS](/offensive/cloud/aws/), [Azure](/offensive/cloud/azure/), and [GCP](/offensive/cloud/gcp/) to compromise resources or elevate privileges.

## Container

Container security breaches often exploit misconfigurations in environments like [Docker](/offensive/container/docker/) and their [orchestration](/offensive/container/orchestration/) frameworks, such as Kubernetes, to execute malicious operations within virtualized environments.

## API

The proliferation of APIs has expanded the attack surface, leading to various attack vectors such as [broken object level authorization](/offensive/api/broken_object_level_authorization/), [broken authentication](/offensive/api/broken_authentication/), and [unrestricted resource consumption](/offensive/api/unrestricted_resource_consumption/). Attackers may exploit weaknesses to gain access to critical operations through [improper inventory management](/offensive/api/improper_inventory_management/) and [unsafe consumption of third-party APIs](/offensive/api/unsafe_consumption_of_apis/).

## Hardware

Offensive hardware tactics leverage vulnerabilities in [peripheral devices](/offensive/hardware/peripheral_devices/), [embedded systems](/offensive/hardware/embedded_systems/), and more, enabling attackers to exploit physical components for unauthorized access or information gathering.

## Wireless

Wireless attack techniques range from [short-range wireless attacks](/offensive/wireless/short-range_wireless_attacks/) to broader [IoT and industrial protocol attacks](/offensive/wireless/iot_and_industrial_protocol_attacks/) and [long-range wireless attacks](/offensive/wireless/long-range_wireless_attacks/), focusing on the inherent weaknesses within wireless communication technologies.

## Physical Security Attacks

Physical attacks circumvent digital security measures by exploiting real-world access points through methods such as [access control bypass](/offensive/physical_security_attacks/access_control_bypass/), [tailgating](/offensive/physical_security_attacks/tailgating__piggybacking/), and [social engineering](/offensive/physical_security_attacks/social_engineering_for_physical_access/).

## Cryptographic

Together with social and technological tactics, [cryptographic attacks](/offensive/cryptographic) primarily target encryption and decryption structures. These can be realized through techniques such as [brute force](/offensive/cryptographic/brute_force_attack/), [ciphertext-only](/offensive/cryptographic/ciphertext-only_attack/), [known plaintext](/offensive/cryptographic/known_plaintext_attack/), [chosen plaintext](/offensive/cryptographic/chosen_plaintext_attack/), and more.

## Exploit Development

Exploit development explores routes to achieve unauthorized control over computer systems. Techniques such as [buffer overflow](/offensive/exploit_development/buffer_overflow/), [return-oriented programming (ROP)](/offensive/exploit_development/return-oriented_programming_rop/), and others are meticulously crafted to break through security layers.

## Red Teaming

Red teaming mirrors realistic threat scenarios, creating sustained, covert campaigns covering areas like [reconnaissance](/offensive/red_teaming/reconnaissance/), [initial access](/offensive/red_teaming/initial_access/), and [command and control (C2)](/offensive/red_teaming/command_and_control_c2/) to test and measure defense mechanisms.

## Evasion

Evasion techniques are designed to bypass modern security measures such as antivirus or [anti-analysis features in malware](/offensive/malware_development/anti-analysis_features/). Deceptive tactics are employed to remain undetected within target environments for prolonged durations.

## Malware Development

Developing malicious software entails crafting [payloads](/offensive/malware_development/payload_crafting/), devising [delivery mechanisms](/offensive/malware_development/delivery_mechanisms/), and ensuring effective [data exfiltration](/offensive/malware_development/data_exfiltration_techniques/).

## Software

Finally, offensive software techniques focus on manipulating applications and frameworks, including [ERP systems](/offensive/software/erp/), [directory services](/offensive/software/directory/), and other critical software components that manage enterprise operations.
