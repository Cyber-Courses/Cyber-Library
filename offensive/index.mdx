# Offensive Cybersecurity Techniques

## [Network Penetration Testing](offensive/Network)

Network penetration testing involves identifying, evaluating, and exploiting vulnerabilities in network infrastructure. Techniques such as [intermediate network scanning](offensive/Scanning/), [network mapping, and enumeration](offensive/Enumeration/) are fundamental. Techniques include exploiting open ports, outdated service versions, and weak network configurations. Tools commonly used include Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit.

Attackers may attempt [initial access techniques](offensive/Initial Access Techniques/) through social engineering or network-based exploits. Once access is gained, the next step involves [exploitation](offensive/Exploitation/) of vulnerable network services using automated tools or custom-developed exploits. Post-exploitation involves [privilege escalation](offensive/Privilege Escalation/) and [lateral movement](offensive/Lateral Movement/) within the organizational network to access sensitive data or systems. Attackers use tunneling channels and proxies to evade detection and send data externally. [Persistence Techniques](offensive/Persistence Techniques/) are employed to maintain access over time.

## [Web Application Exploitation](offensive/Web Application)

Web application exploitation focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities within web applications. Known security flaws include 
vulnerabilities in [server-side](offensive/Server-Side Vulnerabilities/) and [client-side](offensive/Client-Side Vulnerabilities/), stemming from insecure configurations, improper validation, and incomplete authorization logic.

Using automated scanning tools such as Burp Suite and manual testing methods, attackers craft vulnerabilities specific exploits against content management systems (CMSs) ([CMS-Specific Vulnerabilities](offensive/CMS-Specific Vulnerabilities/)) and framework-specific vulnerabilities ([Framework-Specific Vulnerabilities](offensive/Framework-Specific Vulnerabilities/)). To gain higher levels of system compromise, attackers chain exploits and use [multi-stage attacks](offensive/Chained Exploits and Multi-Stage Attacks/).

## [Mobile Application Exploitation](offensive/Mobile Application)

Exploiting mobile applications involves reversing engineering[,] finding [platform-specific vulnerabilities](offensive/Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities/), and exploiting [cross-platform framework vulnerabilities](offensive/Cross-Platform Framework Vulnerabilities/). Attackers commonly focus on [data storage vulnerabilities](offensive/Data Storage Vulnerabilities/) and [communication vulnerabilities](offensive/Communication Vulnerabilities/), exploiting unsecured data storage and intercepting insecure communications.

Authentication and authorization flaws are targeted to bypass system protection layers ([Authentication and Authorization Flaws](offensive/Authentication and Authorization Flaws/)). Attackers can exploit [cryptographic vulnerabilities](offensive/Cryptographic Vulnerabilities/) in mobile applications when flawed cryptographic routines or weak encryption ciphers are used.

## [Supply Chain Compromise](offensive/Supply Chain)

Supply chain compromise involves infiltrating third-party suppliers and vendors ([Vendor Supply Chain Compromise](offensive/Vendor Supply Chain Compromise/)), manipulating hardware ([Hardware Supply Chain Exploits](offensive/Hardware Supply Chain Exploits/)), and exploiting software dependencies. Adversaries target organizations by leveraging changes in the software supply chain infrastructure, gaining unauthorized access, and escalating privileges. Attackers manipulate and tamper with software through malicious code insertions in build processes, deploying compromised software updates to affect a wider range of targets.

## [CI/CD Pipeline Attacks](offensive/CI/CD)

CI/CD pipeline attacks exploit the continuous integration and delivery process stages like [plan](offensive/Plan/), [code](offensive/Code/), [build](offensive/Build/), [test](offensive/Testing/), [release](offensive/Release/), [deploy](offensive/Deploy/), [operate](offensive/Operate/), and [monitor](offensive/Monitor/). Misconfigurations and unsecured integrations are used for targeting these stages. Attackers exploit permissions for deployment tools, inject malicious code into build processes, and may use automated testing as an attack vector. The goal is to introduce vulnerabilities into delivered software without detection.

## [Cloud Environment Exploitation](offensive/Cloud)

Cloud environment exploitation is focused on platforms like [AWS](offensive/AWS/), [Azure](offensive/Azure/), and [GCP](offensive/GCP/). It involves identifying insecure configurations, inadequate access controls, and service misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access. Attacks focus on privilege escalation within the cloud environments, typically abusing overly permissive IAM roles. Criminals can leverage cloud-native vulnerabilities, such as serverless function flaws, excessively provisioned services, and mismanaged cloud storage, to compromise cloud resources.

## [Container Environment Attacks](offensive/Container)

Container environment attacks target misconfigurations and weaknesses in [container](offensive/Container/) orchestration systems like Kubernetes ([Orchestration](offensive/Orchestration/)) and runtime engines like Docker ([Docker](offensive/Docker/)). Attackers seek misconfigured network policies and compromised information within environment variables in containers.

Sophisticated attacks involve breaking out of isolated containers to gain access to the host system and subsequently privilege escalate. Tools such as container scanners assist attackers in identifying outdated or vulnerable components within containerized applications.

## [API Attacks](offensive/API)

API attacks focus on vulnerabilities such as [broken object level authorization](offensive/Broken Object Level Authorization/), [broken authentication](offensive/Broken Authentication/), and [broken object property level authorization](offensive/Broken Object Property Level Authorization/). Attackers often take advantage of poor access control implementations, leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.

Exploitation of API weaknesses like [unrestricted resource consumption](offensive/Unrestricted Resource Consumption/) and improper management of API keys can result in denial of service conditions or unauthorized actions within sensitive applications.

## [Hardware Hacking](offensive/Hardware)

Hardware hacking targets vulnerabilities in [peripheral devices](offensive/Peripheral Devices/), [embedded systems](offensive/Embedded Systems/), and specific components within [industrial control systems](offensive/Industrial Control Systems (ICS)/). Attackers utilize advanced techniques including [JTAG](offensive/JTAG/) and UART interfaces, attacking [networking hardware](offensive/Networking Hardware/) and [computing devices](offensive/Computing Devices/) typically focus on firmware manipulations to alter device functionality or introduce backdoors.

Attackers engage in [reverse engineering](offensive/Reverse Engineering/) processes for code extraction, understanding device logic, and exploiting improper access controls.

## [Wireless Attacks](offensive/Wireless)

Wireless network attacks exploit various communication protocols across [short-range wireless](offensive/Short-Range Wireless Attacks/), [IoT and industrial protocols](offensive/IoT and Industrial Protocol Attacks/), and [long-range wireless](offensive/Long-Range Wireless Attacks/) connections. Attackers leverage techniques such as eavesdropping, interception, and injecting unauthorized commands into vulnerable devices.

Sophisticated assaults target previously acquired engaged wireless protocols like Bluetooth and Zigbee, compromising vital [IoT and ICS](offensive/Industrial Control Systems (ICS)/) systems used in critical infrastructure.

## [Physical Security Attacks](offensive/Physical Security Attacks)

Physical security breaches involve techniques such as [bypassing access control](offensive/Access Control Bypass/) systems and [social engineering](offensive/Social Engineering for Physical Access/) for unauthorized facility access. These can serve any way for implant delivery, [keylogging](offensive/Keylogging and Surveillance/), and installation of hardware Trojans on physical workstations.

[Tailgating/piggybacking](offensive/Tailgating / Piggybacking/) methods are utilized to bypass physical security checkpoints, while attackers may exploit garbage disposal practices ([dumpster diving](offensive/Dumpster Diving/)) to retrieve sensitive discarded information.

## [Cryptographic Attacks](offensive/Cryptographic)

Cryptographic attacks focus on exploiting weaknesses in cryptographic operations such as [ciphertext-only attacks](offensive/Ciphertext-Only Attack/), [chosen plaintext attacks](offensive/Chosen Plaintext Attack/), and [chosen ciphertext attacks](offensive/Chosen Ciphertext Attack/). Attackers probe for flaws in symmetric or asymmetric encryption schemes and mismanaged cryptographic keys. [Side-channel attacks](offensive/Side Channel Attacks/) analyze information leakage resulting from algorithm-specific operations to reconstruct keys or plaintext.

[Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks](offensive/Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack/) involve intercepting and modifying communication between two parties to gain unauthorized access to information. Cryptographic integrity checks and the correct implementation of standards, avoiding weak or backdoored protocols, are necessary to mitigate risk from advanced adversaries.

## [Exploit Development](offensive/Exploit Development)

Exploit development involves identifying and crafting exploits for software vulnerabilities. Developers utilize techniques such as [buffer overflow](offensive/Buffer Overflow/), [format string attack](offensive/Format String Attack/), and advanced [return-oriented programming](offensive/Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)/) to leverage system or application vulnerabilities.

Attackers script exploits for automation and efficiency, discovering vulnerabilities through [fuzzing](offensive/Fuzzing for Vulnerability Discovery/) techniques. Crafting reliable [heap exploitation](offensive/Heap Exploitation/) and [shellcode](offensive/Shellcode Development/) are vital steps towards executing targeted actions on compromised applications.

## [Red Teaming](offensive/Red Teaming)

Red teaming replicates advanced adversary tactics within an organization to evaluate cybersecurity measures. Through [reconnaissance](offensive/Reconnaissance/), [initial access](offensive/Initial Access/), and [persistence](offensive/Persistence/), teams emulate realistic threat scenarios to test defense mechanisms. 

They engage in [lateral movement](offensive/Lateral Movement/) and [privilege escalation](offensive/Privilege Escalation/) to simulate insider threats, determining adversary detection capabilities. Adept command and control (C2) utilization [(Command and Control (C2))](offensive/Command and Control (C2)/) facilitates prolonged engagement for exhaustive security posture assessments.

## [Evasion Techniques](offensive/Evasion)

Advanced evasion techniques are employed by threat actors to bypass malware protection, disguise network traffic, and evade forensic tools. Techniques include malware code obfuscation, code signing, and crafting scriptless attacks to avoid signature-based detection systems.

Insidious tactics involve manipulating memory against detection, performing anti-forensics, and disguising habitual actions in networks. Attackers employ extensive mechanisms to establish stealthy persistence, ensuring long-term undetected access with minimal system footprint.

## [Malware Development](offensive/Malware Development)

Malware development involves creating and deploying diverse malware strains with emphasis on [delivery mechanisms](offensive/Delivery Mechanisms/), [payload crafting](offensive/Payload Crafting/), and [command and control (C2)](offensive/Command and Control (C2) Design/). Developers focus on offensive and defensive capabilities, crafting features that complicate detecting and reversing operations.

Maintaining persistence across hosts using custom [persistence mechanisms](offensive/Persistence Mechanisms/) solidifies attack sustainability. Anti-analysis features are integrated to prevent decompilation and sandbox evasion, further complicating analysis efforts of defensive personnel.

## [Software-Based Attacks](offensive/Software)

Software-based attacks target various applications, including [ERP systems](offensive/ERP/), [directory services](offensive/Directory/), and vulnerabilities within [CI/CD tools](offensive/CI/CD/). Exploitation often involves targeting specific interfaces, library functions, and inter-module communication to unleash undefined behavior consistent with application context.
