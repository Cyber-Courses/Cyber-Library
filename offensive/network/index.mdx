## Offensive Network Security

### Scanning

Network scanning involves probing a network to discover active hosts, services, and potential vulnerabilities. The goals of scanning are identifying open ports, live systems, and weaknesses that can be exploited later in an attack. Various scan types, such as connection (TCP connect), stealth SYN scans, and UDP scans, serve different purposes based on the attacker's objectives and the target's network defenses. Connection scans establish a full TCP connection, while stealth scans (such as SYN scans) send TCP SYN packets to evade firewalls.

Nmap is a widely used tool for network scanning. It enables attackers to map networks by providing details about live hosts and open ports, along with service and OS detection capabilities. Unicornscan and Masscan are other robust scanning tools, with Masscan known for its ability to scan vast ranges quickly due to its asynchronous capabilities. 

During network mapping, the attacker distinguishes host details and services, often using service banners or version detection techniques to understand potential vulnerabilities. OS detection further helps pinpoint the probable operating systems running on the target, aiding in a tailored attack strategy.

### Enumeration

Enumeration follows scanning and is the process of extracting more detailed information about network components to understand configurations and potential exploits. It serves as a bridge between external network reconnaissance and subsequent exploitation phases, focusing on obtaining further insights, like user lists, routing tables, and application specifics.

Active enumeration involves direct interaction with target systems, such as SMB (Server Message Block) and DNS to gather data like shared resources or domain records. Tools like SMB enumeration scripts in Nmap or using utilities like `dig` and `dnsenum` help enumerate potential vulnerabilities and configurations.

Authentication protocols, particularly LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and Kerberos, offer fertile ground for enumeration. Attackers often leverage these to identify domain controllers or obtain user credentials via incorrect configurations or protocol weaknesses.

### Initial Access Techniques

Initial access techniques are methods attackers use to gain a foothold on a network. These may involve exploiting vulnerabilities within network protocols or socially engineering personnel within the target organization. Initial access sets the stage for deeper penetration into the network.

Exploiting network protocols often involves taking advantage of weaknesses in services like FTP, SSH, or Telnet. For instance, open FTP servers without proper authentication may allow anonymous access, while weaknesses in SSH configurations can be exploited for unauthorized entry. Similarly, poorly secured SMB or RDP configurations may grant an attacker a foothold within the network.

Social engineering often complements technical exploits. Phishing campaigns are designed to trick users into divulging credentials or executing malicious payloads, bypassing technical defenses by exploiting human vulnerability instead. Phishing may involve sophisticated setups like spear-phishing to target specific individuals within the organization.

### Exploitation

The exploitation phase involves using discovered vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code or perform unauthorized actions on a system. This step often involves leveraging known vulnerabilities to gain initial system access or escalate privileges.

Network exploitation often focuses on widely known vulnerabilities, such as EternalBlue for SMB or Heartbleed for OpenSSL. These vulnerabilities are sought after because they enable remote execution of code or information disclosure. When properly identified, these offer attackers an entry point for more significant network penetration.

Tools like the Metasploit Framework significantly aid in exploitation by providing a library of exploits that can be configured and launched against a target. Many exploits can be found on platforms like Exploit-DB, which maintains a repository of publicly known vulnerabilities and exploits.

### Post Exploitation

Post-exploitation involves actions taken after a system has been compromised. The focus is on gathering more network information, maintaining access, and making networks more resilient to future compromises by patching evident weaknesses.

Upon successful exploitation, the attacker typically performs a thorough evaluation of the compromised environment: mapping out the internal network, assessing the value of accessed data, and determining pathways to escalate access levels or move laterally within the network. Tunneling techniques help maintain access by concealing activity or rerouting network traffic.

Data exfiltration is critical in post-exploitation, referring to the unauthorized transfer of data out of the target network. Techniques include using steganography to hide data within images, encrypted tunnels to prevent detection by traditional monitoring tools, and leveraging covert channels like DNS to extract data unnoticed.

### Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation is a critical step in network attacks, allowing attackers to gain higher-level access to network resources. By exploiting weaknesses in system configurations or services, attackers elevate their privileges from basic user to administrative levels.

Vertical escalation involves gaining higher permissions within the same account, while horizontal escalation is impersonating another user account with higher privileges. Attackers exploit weak configurations, such as poorly set permissions on files, applications, or binaries that do not adequately restrict access. 

Protocols like SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) are often targeted for privilege escalation, especially if community strings are default or poorly configured. If attackers can glean specific information about the network setup, they may redirect or manipulate traffic using techniques like ICMP redirects to elevate privileges further.

### Lateral Movement 

Lateral movement is the process of expanding access from the initially compromised system to other devices or systems within the network. It is crucial for gaining control over additional network resources and achieving broader network infiltration.

Popular techniques for lateral movement involve exploiting credential caches to pass-the-hash, allowing attackers to authenticate as different users without knowing their passwords. Common tools that aid in lateral movement include Windows Management Instrumentation Command (WMIC) and PsExec, which facilitate command execution on remote Windows systems.

Exploiting remote services such as RDP or SSH offers further opportunities. By gaining access to secure shell sessions, attackers can move across devices while maintaining encrypted communication, reducing the risk of detection.

### Persistence Techniques 

Persistence techniques are those employed by attackers to maintain access to compromised systems over extended periods, ensuring they can return to compromised environments as needed.

Network configurations present various opportunities for persistence. DHCP and DNS manipulations can subtly redirect network communications, while ARP spoofing can allow attackers to intercept internal traffic. These techniques help attackers sustain access and minimize their detection footprint.

Attackers may also install backdoors or custom remote access trojans (RATs) to secure a means of re-entry. Web shells are another favored method, allowing command execution over web servers and ensuring continued control through standard HTTP/HTTPS interfaces. 

By using these techniques strategically, attackers can maintain long-term access and control within networks, posing ongoing threats despite defensive efforts.
