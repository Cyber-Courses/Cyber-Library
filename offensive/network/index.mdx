# Offensive Security: Network Exploitation

## Scanning

As the foundation of network exploitation, scanning is crucial for gaining an initial understanding of the target environment. This phase involves identifying active hosts, open ports, and services that could potentially be exploited. Techniques for network mapping and vulnerability scanning are imperative. 

Refer to the following subtopics to delve deeper:
- [Scanning](offensive/network/Scanning)
- [Identifying Open Ports](offensive/network/Identifying%20Open%20Ports/)
- [OS and Version Detection](offensive/network/OS%20and%20Version%20Detection/)
- [Network Mapping](offensive/network/Network%20Mapping/)

### Network Mapping Techniques

Network mapping involves using tools such as Nmap to gather a comprehensive view of the network landscape. It helps in identifying IP addresses, subnets, and the structure of the network. Accurate network maps assist in pinpointing critical assets and paths for further exploration. Advanced options, like `nmap -sP <target network>`, provide a stealthier mapping option.

### Port Scanning Tactics

Port scanning is used to discover services running on network hosts. Techniques such as SYN, FIN, ACK, and NULL scans are employed to probe these services while minimizing detection. An example command, `nmap -sS <target>`, performs a stealthy SYN scan to identify open TCP ports.

### Vulnerability Scanning

With details of open ports and services, vulnerability scanning tools like Nessus or OpenVAS are utilized to identify known vulnerabilities. These tools scan for misconfigurations and outdated software versions, earmarking potential exploits. Commands like `nessus -q -i <target>` initiate scans for vulnerability assessment.

## Enumeration

Enumeration follows scanning, focusing on extracting detailed information from network services. It's instrumental in understanding more about the targetâ€™s configuration and identifying weaknesses for exploitation.

Explore comprehensive enumeration techniques here:
- [Enumeration](offensive/network/Enumeration)

### Service Enumeration

Services like HTTP, FTP, and DNS can reveal valuable information that aids in network exploitation. Commands such as `nmap --script=http-enum <target>` can identify detailed HTTP configurations and versions running on their servers.

### Network Protocol Enumeration

Specific protocols provide vectors for further enumeration and potential exploitation. Tools like `enum4linux` can be leveraged for extensive interrogation of SMB services. Ensure you explore the full range of network protocols for enumeration:
- [HTTP Enumeration](offensive/network/HTTP%20Enumeration/)
- [SMB Enumeration](offensive/network/SMB%20Enumeration/)

## Initial Access Techniques

Initial access involves breaking into the network using sophisticated methodologies, leveraging identified vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.

For in-depth exploration of initial access methodologies, refer to:
- [Initial Access Techniques](offensive/network/Initial%20Access%20Techniques)

### Phishing with Network Manipulation

Crafting phishing attacks that are enhanced by network-based tactics can increase effectiveness. Use DNS spoofing in conjunction with phishing emails to lead targets to a malicious site.

### Zero-Day Exploitation

Utilizing zero-day vulnerabilities requires a high level of expertise and can offer unique access opportunities. These vulnerabilities typically go unnoticed due to their undisclosed nature.

## Exploitation

Exploitation involves manipulating identified vulnerabilities to execute malicious code or commands on target systems.

- [Exploitation](offensive/network/Exploitation)

### Exploit Development for Network Services

Developing exploits for vulnerable services requires knowledge of the underlying technologies and potential faults within their protocols. Utilize `Metasploit` for automating exploitation with commands like `msfconsole` and navigating the framework commands.

### In-memory Exploitation

Engage in-memory exploitation to compromise the application logic while minimizing traces. This involves exploiting application vulnerabilities without writing files to the system disk.

## Post Exploitation

Once initial exploitation is successful, further actions are undertaken to consolidate access, gather intelligence, and exfiltrate data.

Advanced post-exploitation tactics can be explored in:
- [Post Exploitation](offensive/network/Post%20Exploitation)

### Data Exfiltration Techniques

Data exfiltration must be stealthy. Techniques like packet crafting, covert channels, and data fragmentation ensure sensitive information is exfiltrated without notice.

## Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation focuses on obtaining higher-level permissions on the system, often granting more extensive access to network resources.

For detailed exploration, see:
- [Privilege Escalation](offensive/network/Privilege%20Escalation)

### Local Privilege Escalation

Local privilege escalation exploits software bugs, configuration errors, or oversights to gain elevated access locally on compromised systems.

## Lateral Movement

Lateral movement refers to moving deeper into the network post-compromise, often targeting critical systems beyond initial infiltration.

Learn more about lateral movement tactics here:
- [Lateral Movement](offensive/network/Lateral%20Movement)

### Leveraging Active Directory

Exploiting Active Directory environments for lateral movement involves abusing trust relationships and poorly configured roles.

## Persistence Techniques

Persistence involves ensuring continued access to the compromised network, circumventing potential countermeasures.

### Network-based Persistence Mechanisms

Embedding persistence mechanisms into network devices or configuration changes helps maintain long-term access without constant manual intervention.
