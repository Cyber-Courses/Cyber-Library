### Identifying TNS Listener on Network

The task of identifying a Transparent Network Substrate (TNS) Listener on a network involves using a combination of port scanning, protocol analysis, and exploitation of vulnerabilities present in Oracle's networking protocol. The TNS Listener is critical for Oracle database communication, and by detecting its presence, cybersecurity professionals can assess potential entry points for network exploitation.

#### Scanning for Open Ports

The first step in locating a TNS Listener is to scan for open TCP ports, especially port 1521, which is the default port for Oracle TNS services. This can be achieved using various port scanning tools:

- **Nmap**: Nmap is the most widely used network scanner for this purpose. Utilize the command `nmap -p 1521 <target-ip>` to check if the port is open, indicating a potential TNS Listener. Stealth scanning techniques, such as `nmap -sS -p 1521 <target-ip>`, can be used to decrease detection chances by firewalls and IDS by only sending SYN packets instead of completing the TCP handshake.
  
- **Masscan**: Suitable for large-scale port scanning, Masscan can be used with the command `masscan <target-subnet> -p 1521 --rate=1000` to scan subnets at high speed.

Once an open port is identified, further checks through banner grabbing may reveal the presence and version of the Oracle TNS Listener, allowing for deeper analysis and potential version-specific exploits.

#### Network Traffic Analysis

Analyzing network traffic for Oracle TNS-specific signatures can effectively identify TNS Listener presence without direct interaction. Use packet capture tools like Wireshark to monitor traffic for known TNS patterns:

- Capture packets on suspected Oracle database servers and search for communication patterns typical of Oracleâ€™s TNS protocol.
- Filters in Wireshark, like `tcp.port == 1521`, can isolate traffic on the Oracle TNS ports. 

Look for the initial handshake and session setup specific to Oracle client-server communication, which can confirm the presence of a listening TNS service.

#### Utilizing Nmap for TNS Detection

Nmap provides specialized scripts that can be employed to detect Oracle TNS Listeners more reliably:

- Execute Nmap with Oracle-specific scripts such as `nmap -sV -p 1521 --script=oracle-tns-version <target-ip>`, which attempts to communicate with the listener and gather version information.
- Custom Nmap scripts can be crafted to probe more intricate network setups or non-standard port configurations by modifying existing scripts or creating new NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) scripts.

#### Exploiting Vulnerabilities in TNS Protocol

Identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in the TNS protocol can highlight the presence of a TNS Listener. Techniques include:

- Researching CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to Oracle TNS to find known exploits that result in server responses revealing their presence.
- Using penetration testing tools like Metasploit to target specific vulnerabilities, which can provide responses suggestive of an active TNS Listener.

#### Social Engineering and OSINT

Employing social engineering can reveal network configurations that hint at TNS Listener existence. Techniques include:

- Contacting network administrators under a pretext to gain insights into the infrastructure.
- Using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to find IP addresses or domains associated with Oracle services that may inadvertently expose TNS Listeners.

#### Automation of TNS Listener Discovery

Automating the discovery of TNS Listeners streamlines the process, especially in large networks:

- Scripts in languages like Python using libraries such as 'scapy' can automate network scans and packet analysis.
- Metasploit Framework offers auxiliary modules, for example, `oracle_tnsprobe`, which automates TNS Listener discovery and version enumeration.

#### Anomaly Detection in Network Behavior

Detecting anomalies in network traffic can imply the presence of a TNS Listener:

- Implement machine learning models to analyze traffic patterns deviating from the baseline, which could indicate unauthorized Oracle network activities.
- Use existing anomaly detection tools to flag unusual traffic spikes or new Oracle service interactions on default ports.

#### Cross-referencing Network Topology Maps

Utilizing network topology information assists in identifying probable locations with TNS Listeners:

- Analyze documented network topologies or use network mapping tools to hypothesize potential TNS setups based on traffic flow and server clusters.
- Recognize high-traffic areas housing database applications likely accompanied by TNS Listeners.

#### Bypassing Network Filters and Firewalls

Evasion strategies might be necessary if network filters or firewalls block attempts to identify TNS Listeners:

- Modify scanning techniques to use non-standard ports or fragmented packets, reducing the chances of being blocked by a firewall.
- Evaluate the presence of deep packet inspection (DPI) tools and craft packet streams that elude these checks, possibly using tools like `Fragroute` to send segmented data bypassing the DPI checks.
