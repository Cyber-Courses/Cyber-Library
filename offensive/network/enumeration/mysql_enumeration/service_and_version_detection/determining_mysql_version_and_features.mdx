# Determining MySQL Version and Features

## Banner Grabbing Techniques for MySQL

Banner grabbing is a straightforward initial technique used to determine the version of a MySQL service. This can be done manually or automated through tools. Manually, tools like `netcat` or `telnet` are employed to connect to the MySQL port (default is 3306). For example, using `netcat`, a connection can be made as follows:

```bash
nc -v <target-IP> 3306
```

On successful connection, MySQL servers typically send a greeting message containing version data. Automating this process with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) enhances efficiency. Using an NSE script, this can be done efficiently:

```bash
nmap -p 3306 --script mysql-info <target-IP>
```

Banner grabbing provides instant feedback on the MySQL version but beware of discrepancies across different MySQL configurations, particularly custom servers that may obfuscate their banners.

## Analyzing MySQL Error Messages

Error messages provide inadvertent disclosure of MySQL version information. By crafting deliberate SQL syntax errors, attackers can elicit error responses that often include version data. Example query to cause an error:

```sql
SELECT * FROM non_existent_table;
```

Different versions yield varied messages or codes, which can often correlate with specific versions or features. Similarly, testing boundary conditions or malformed queries may reveal version-specific behaviors not apparent in typical interactions.

## Using MySQL Information Schema

Direct querying can unveil MySQL version and capabilities through the information schema. Executing a query like:

```sql
SELECT VERSION();
```

provides precise version information. Moreover, extensive attributes can be pulled using:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%version%';
```

This query returns detailed variables indicating engine specifics or additional features particular to a version, helping to understand default enabled settings and capabilities.

## Fingerprinting MySQL Instances

Beyond banners, fingerprinting aims to extract nuanced version details, utilizing scripts like `mysql_version` or `mysql-info` in Nmap helps ascertain version and feature support. Commands such as:

```sql
SELECT @@version_comment;
```

hone in on server specifics. Also, exploring authentication mechanisms through queries like:

```sql
SELECT @@global.old_passwords;
```

can elucidate version-era password storage format usages.

## Bypassing Authentication Mechanisms

Misconfigurations often allow authentication bypass, facilitating version checks. Default account credentials or brute force might yield access, particularly leveraging well-documented default MySQL user accounts. This involves attempting to log in as "root" without a password, or using SQL-based vulnerability scripts targeting older version vulnerabilities to gain clearance to private version data.

## Detection of MySQL Plugins and Extensions

Plugins and extensions can provide indirect evidence of MySQL versioning. Running:

```sql
SHOW PLUGINS;
```

and

```sql
SHOW ENGINES;
```

enumerates installed extensions, often reflective of version options since different MySQL releases bundle or support varied plugins and storage engines, providing critical feature validation.

## Assessing MySQL Patch Levels

To recognize specific MySQL patch levels, attempt eliciting known vulnerabilities exploitation responses. The absence or presence of a response might instantiate a specific version or patch level. Testing should focus on known vulnerabilities for specific versions from CVE lists:

```sql
-- Specific commands or payloads crafted for a vulnerability
```

Regularly updated databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) detail which MySQL versions are susceptible under what conditions, aiding precise mappings.

## Leveraging Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

OSINT can inadvertently reveal MySQL version via leaks or misconfigurations in online-facing resources. This might involve searching:

- GitHub for exposed configuration files.
- Backup files detected online indicating setup data.
- Publicly accessible logs via weakly configured web servers or services such as PHPMyAdmin, often directly reflecting database versioning.

## Exploration with Advanced Enumeration Tools

Tools such as SQLMap perform rigorous MySQL variant explorations, enabling more profound probing of version information by executing various automated checks. Adapting or developing plugins/scripts simulating SQLMap tactics provides tailored enumeration well-suited to specific target attributes. Scrutinizing metadata extracted via these tools can disclose unusual version indications previously unnoticed through standard techniques. Such exhaustive inquiry fortifies certainty about the MySQL version and applicable features, paving the way for a strategic and informed offensive security posture.
