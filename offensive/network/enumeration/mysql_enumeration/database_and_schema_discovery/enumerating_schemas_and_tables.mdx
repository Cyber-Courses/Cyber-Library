### Enumerating Schemas and Tables

#### Obtaining MySQL Version in Use

Understanding the version of MySQL in use is critical in tailoring your approach for schema and table enumeration. Different versions may have distinct vulnerabilities, capabilities, or default settings that can be leveraged during enumeration. To determine the version, one can execute the SQL command:

```sql
SELECT VERSION();
```

This command returns the current MySQL server version, setting the stage for targeted attacks. Knowledge of the version allows attackers to explore specific known vulnerabilities or deprecated features that may aid in enumeration. Additionally, understanding the version informs the attacker about the SQL syntax and functions that can be exploited during subsequent enumeration steps.

#### Gaining Authentication

Authentication is a pivotal step in gaining legitimate or illegitimate access to MySQL databases before enumeration queries can be executed. Several techniques can be employed to obtain necessary credentials:

- **Password Cracking**: Use dictionary attacks, rainbow tables, or tools like Hydra to crack weak password hashes that may have been retrieved from configuration files or during network traffic analysis.
  
- **Exploitation of Misconfigurations**: Analyze the database and network settings for common misconfigurations such as default accounts, weak passwords, or inappropriate user privileges. Attempt to connect with default credentials for MySQL administrative accounts like `root`.

Successful authentication is evidenced by gaining access to the MySQL shell or executing SQL commands that confirm user privileges.

#### Accessing the MySQL Database

Once authentication is achieved, it is essential to establish a connection to the MySQL server. This involves using valid credentials to access the database system, typically through command-line clients like `mysql` or remote management tools. The connection command could resemble the following:

```bash
mysql -u username -p -h hostname
```

This line initiates a command-line connection, prompting for the password and specifying the desired hostname. Accessing the database efficiently sets the groundwork for effective enumeration of schemas and tables.

#### Schema Enumeration Techniques

Schema enumeration involves uncovering the different databases or schemas within a MySQL instance, offering insight into the scope and structure of the target system. Key techniques include:

- **SQL Injection for Schema Discovery**: Leveraging SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities in web applications can expose schema information. With error-based SQLi, errors returned from the database can indicate schema structure. Union-based SQLi allows injection of custom SQL to list all schemas.

- **Information Schema Queries**: MySQL maintains meta-information in `information_schema`. Use:

  ```sql
  SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata;
  ```
  
  Execute this query to list all schemas. Information schema queries offer a straightforward path to extract structured information directly from the server.

- **Brute Force Schema Names**: When direct listing is not possible, scripts dealing with common or contextually-expected schema names can attempt numerous combinations, hoping to stumble across valid schema names.

#### Table Enumeration within Schemas

Once schemas are identified, the focus shifts to enumerating tables within these schemas. Effective enumeration of tables can employ several methods:

- **Querying Information Schema Tables**: Similar to schema enumeration, querying the `information_schema`:

  ```sql
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='target_schema';
  ```

  This query reveals all table names in a particular schema.

- **Blind SQL Injection for Table Enumeration**: Where interaction with the database doesn't return responses, time-based SQL injection can infer table names by timing delays:

  ```sql
  SELECT IF(ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1),1,1))>100,SLEEP(5),NULL);
  ```

  This command checks if the ASCII value of the first character of a table name matches certain criteria, introducing delays based on the response, inferring table names character by character.

- **Automated Tools for Table Enumeration**: Tools like `sqlmap` can automate the table enumeration process, handling complex SQL injection vectors and query crafting. A simple command to initiate sqlmap could look like:

  ```bash
  sqlmap --url "http://example.com/vulnerable_page" --dbs --tables -D target_schema
  ```

  This executes an automated scan, attempting to enumerate tables within the specified schema.

#### Verification and Persistence

Once enumeration yields results, validation ensures accuracy and utility of the extracted information:

- **Validate Extracted Information**: Compare the discovered schema and table details against application functionality, logs, or known documentation to verify their relevance and accuracy.

- **Maintaining Access for Continuous Enumeration**: Establishing a persistent backdoor can facilitate ongoing enumeration as the database evolves. Creating stored procedures or utilizing cron jobs on compromised systems ensures sustained access, allowing continued monitoring and enumeration without repeated authentication efforts. Implementing persistence requires careful crafting to avoid detection, safeguarding the established access.
