## Identifying Privileged Accounts

### Understanding Privileged Account Types

**Root and Administrator Accounts**

Root and Administrator accounts are the highest level of access within a system, typically possessing full control over the operating system's functionality. On Unix-like systems, the root account (UID 0) has unrestricted access, enabling the user to execute system-level operations such as modifying protected files, configuring system services, and managing user accounts. Similarly, on Windows systems, the Administrator account has full control over the machine and can perform actions such as installing software, modifying system settings, and accessing all files. Identifying such accounts typically involves checking for accounts with high privilege levels and verifying their permissions within the system.

**Service Accounts with Elevated Privileges**

Service accounts often run application processes and require elevated privileges to function correctly. These accounts are not tied to a user but rather to a specific service task, often operating under limited controls. Identifying service accounts involves examining user account descriptors and group memberships to uncover privileges that may not be immediately visible. It is crucial to analyze the roles and permissions assigned to these accounts, as they may inadvertently provide excessive access.

**Domain Admin and Enterprise Admin Accounts**

Domain and Enterprise Admin accounts are essential in Windows Server environments, particularly within Active Directory contexts. Domain Admin accounts have administrative rights across the domain, granting them the ability to manage domain-wide settings and resources. Enterprise Admin accounts possess privileges that span across multiple domains within a forest, providing control over forest-level configurations. Identifying these accounts involves querying Active Directory databases and analyzing group memberships for accounts in the "Domain Admins" and "Enterprise Admins" groups.

### Enumerating Privileged Accounts

**Gathering Enumeration Data**

Effective enumeration begins with data gathering, focusing on remotely accessible accounts and their privileges. Utilizing tools such as `enum4linux` for Unix environments or `net` commands on Windows can reveal important insights. For instance, `net user /domain` on Windows can list all user accounts within the domain, while `enum4linux -a <target-IP>` enumerates users, shares, and group memberships on Linux-based machines.

**Analyzing Security Policies**

Security policies can provide a wealth of information about privileged accounts. By reviewing Group Policy Objects (GPOs), one can identify accounts that bypass certain security constraints. For Windows systems, tools like `gpresult /h gpresult.html` can be used to analyze applied GPOs and assess the security settings relevant to privileged accounts. This review can highlight potential misconfigurations or policies inadvertently providing excess access.

**Credential Harvesting for Verification**

Verifying potentially privileged accounts occasionally requires credential harvesting followed by testing on suspected accounts. In offensive security, the use of tools like `Mimikatz` allows for the extraction of plaintext passwords, hashes, or Kerberos tickets then enabling testing and confirmation of privileges. It's important to employ such tools ethically and within the bounds of legal guidelines during assessment activities.

### Privilege Escalation Indicators

**Analyzing System Logs**

System logs serve as a crucial resource for identifying activities associated with privilege escalation. Examine security and audit logs to detect anomalies, such as account logins from unexpected locations or repeated login attempts. Tools like Splunk or ELK Stack can help aggregate and parse log data to highlight suspicious activities linked to privileged accounts.

**Exploiting Misconfigurations**

Identifying misconfigurations allows for potential privilege escalation. This might involve examining user permissions and system roles, looking for excess privileges beyond operational necessity. Exploitation can occur through gaps like improper service configurations or users having administrative rights without necessity, emphasizing the need for consistent permissions audits.

**Leveraging Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

Many systems rely on third-party applications that, if vulnerable, can be exploited for privilege escalation. Regularly updating and patching software is critical; nevertheless, awareness of and the ability to identify and exploit such vulnerabilities is key in offensive cybersecurity, driving the need for continuous testing and monitoring.

### Tools and Frameworks for Privileged Account Enumeration

**Common Enumerating Tools and Their Features**

A multitude of tools exists to facilitate account enumeration. Tools like `BloodHound` leverage graph theory to identify and analyze complex relationships within Active Directory, highlighting paths to privilege escalation. `Nmap`, often used for network discovery, can also script account discovery using NSE scripts like `smb-enum-users`.

**Integrating with Automation Frameworks**

Automation frameworks, such as `Metasploit`, enable comprehensive scripting, allowing for automated enumeration of user accounts and escalation paths. By integrating multiple tools, cyber professionals can streamline operationsâ€”aiding in rapid identification of privilege accounts while maintaining robust data sets for analysis.

### Maintaining Persistence with Privileged Accounts

**Backdoor Techniques**

Backdoors can be installed within privileged accounts to maintain persistent access. This involves methods like modifying account login scripts or placing unauthorized SSH keys in an account's authorized list. Crafting these access methods often integrates stealth elements to avoid detection and ensure continued access over extended periods.

**Hijacking Privileged Sessions**

Session hijacking involves taking control of an active session authenticated to a privileged account. This can be achieved through techniques such as token impersonation or exploiting vulnerabilities within session management protocols. Preserving the state of hijacked sessions while actively monitoring the owner's activity can yield insights and opportunities to exploit.

### Incident Evasion Techniques

**Bypassing Audit Controls**

To bypass audit controls, attackers must manipulate event logs to obscure their activities. This could involve the deletion of specific logs or generating misleading entries. Tools like `Clear-EventLog` can temporarily disrupt logging on Windows systems but must be used judiciously to prevent detection during post-compromise analysis.

**Utilizing Proxy Techniques**

Using proxies helps disguise the origin of connections while engaging in activities through privileged accounts. Implementing SOCKS proxies or VPNs can mask the source IP, allowing attackers to blend into legitimate traffic. Maintaining a low profile ensures that the security teams remain unaware of adversarial presence within an infrastructure.
