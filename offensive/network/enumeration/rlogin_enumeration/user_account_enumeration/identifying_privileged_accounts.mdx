# Identifying Privileged Accounts

## Enumeration Techniques

Enumeration is fundamental in uncovering the structure and vulnerabilities of a network. Offensive cybersecurity practitioners begin by identifying privileged accounts through precise enumeration techniques.

### Network Scanning

Network scanning tools like Nmap or Masscan can identify active hosts and expose open ports associated with authentication services. By targeting specific ports, it becomes possible to determine which services are operational. For privileged account detection, attention is often directed towards ports commonly used by administrative services, such as SSH (port 22) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) (port 3389). Utilizing advanced Nmap scripts, one can probe these ports to extract detailed service information that may reveal account privilege levels.

Example:
```bash
nmap -p 22,3389 --script=ssh-hostkey,rdp-vuln-ms12-020 <target_ip>
```

### Banner Grabbing

Banner grabbing involves connecting to a service and capturing its transmission response. This response often includes software version details or potentially, user account information inadvertently exposed due to misconfiguration. This kind of enumeration can be performed using tools like Netcat or Telnet. Banners might disclose details about authentication mechanisms or directly related privileged account information.

Example:
```bash
nc -v <target_ip> 22
```

### Service Inspection

Each service exposed on the network can sometimes yield more insights through manual inspection or exploitation. Service inspections involve sending atypical messages or malformed packets to services to extract non-standard responses. This process often requires a deep understanding of protocol handshakes and service interactions to pinpoint operations tied to privileged accounts. Tools like Metasploit or custom scripts can facilitate these operations.

## Privilege Escalation Identification

Recognizing privilege escalation possibilities offers pathways to exploit them for deeper network infiltration.

### Identifying Default Credentials

Exploiting default credentials requires a scan through various services and devices, checking if factory settings have not been altered. This underscores the critical administrative oversight where sensitive defaults are left unchanged, revealing high-level administrative access.

Example tools: Hydra for automated password guesswork.

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<target_ip>
```

### Analyzing Configuration Files

Configuration files are sometimes improperly secured, storing sensitive information like credentials in plaintext. Investigating these files thoroughly can reveal privileged user and account details. Present in locations typically overlooked in routine security settings, these may be accessible on compromised machines or unsafe configurations across shared network directories.

## Exploiting Misconfigurations

Security flaws often originate from inadequacies in configuration.

### Assessment of Improper Permissions

Weak permissions on file systems and network shares allow unintended data exposure. During exploration, attackers seek improperly configured permissions enabling unauthorized users to read, write, or execute files associated with privileged accounts. Tools like AccessChk can be advantageous in such examinations.

Example:
```bash
AccessChk.exe -a -u <user> <directory>
```

### Inspection of Authentication Logs

Authentication logs maintain records of login attempts and account activities. A detailed analysis of these logs often reveals patterns indicative of privileged user behaviors or failed access attempts that may point to targeted attack efforts. Parsing through these systematically can clarify which accounts possess elevated privileges.

## User Account Categorization

Understanding the network's user structure is paramount in discerning privilege distribution.

### Role-Based Analysis

Beyond identifying individual accounts, recognizing roles within the system can expose accounts with administrative capabilities. An analysis of roles can help create a hierarchy of account permissions and identify vectors leading to the escalation of privileges.

### Comparative Account Analysis

By comparing permissions and behaviors across various accounts, attackers can identify anomalies or distinctions marking an account as having been escalated inappropriately. Disparities in access or activity signals potential targets for further escalation or exploitation attempts.

## Detection Evasion

Evasion ensures sustained access during reconnaissance.

### Usage of Legitimate Access Attempts

Emulating legitimate user behavior by mimicking entry scripts or access patterns can reduce the likelihood of detection. This involves adjusting scanning and probing tactics to appear as normal traffic, using previously authenticated sessions or accounts.

### Maintaining OpSec

Operational security (OpSec) involves measures to keep one's activities clandestine. Using encrypted communications, anonymizing services such as proxy chains, and consistent log cleanup practices are essential to minimize traceable footprints while identifying privileged accounts.

By deeply integrating these approaches, offensive cybersecurity professionals can identify and manipulate privileged accounts, paving the way for more extensive penetration operations.
