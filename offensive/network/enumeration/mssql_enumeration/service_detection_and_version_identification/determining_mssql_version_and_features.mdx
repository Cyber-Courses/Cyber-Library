# Determining MSSQL Version and Features

## Overview of MSSQL Version Identification

Accurately identifying the Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) version and its associated features is essential for crafting effective offensive cyber strategies. This knowledge allows cybersecurity professionals to leverage known vulnerabilities and optimize attack methods suited to the specific configurations of the target. It is crucial to utilize various techniques that range from simple banner grabbing to more sophisticated queries and network protocol analysis for comprehensive MSSQL version detection.

## Techniques for MSSQL Version Detection

### Banner Grabbing

Banner grabbing involves capturing information from service banners, which often disclose software versions and other pertinent details. Tools such as `nmap` can be used effectively to perform this task.

- **Network Service Banners**: Run the command `nmap -sV -p 1433 <target-ip>` to scan the MSSQL server on the default port. This command requests a response from the MSSQL service, which frequently returns a banner containing version information.
  
- **Custom Scripting**: Develop scripts capable of initiating a connection to the MSSQL server, specifically targeting the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol used by MSSQL. By interpreting the response, these scripts can extract version details. A Python script using `socket` can be employed to achieve this aim.

### SQL Queries for Version Information

Direct interaction with the SQL server using queries helps in identifying the version number and features directly from the database engine.

- **SYSTEM Function Utilization**: Execute the following query to extract detailed version information:

  ```sql
  SELECT @@VERSION;
  ```

  This command returns a string that includes the SQL Server version, OS details, and the version release date.

- **Feature Flags**: Determine the MSSQL edition and features enabled by querying:

  ```sql
  SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') AS Edition, SERVERPROPERTY('ProductVersion') AS ProductVersion;
  ```

  This provides insight into whether the installation is a Developer, Enterprise, or Standard edition, along with version specifics.

### Exploiting Error Messages

Understanding error generation mechanisms can provide indirect insight into the server:

- **Error-based Version Identification**: Error messages can sometimes reveal version information. Executing incorrect or malformed queries might trigger these messages.
  
- **Forced Errors**: Deliberately sending erroneous queries can be used to provoke detailed error messages. For instance:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM non_existent_table;
  ```

  This query will fail, potentially exposing version details in its error response.

### Client-Server Protocol Analysis

Analyzing the initial MSSQL connection phase can provide valuable information about the server’s version and configurations.

- **Packet Inspection Tools**: With tools like Wireshark, observe the traffic between the client and server. Capture data packets during the initial handshake to analyze TDS packets for version strings.
  
- **Protocol Anomalies**: Given that different MSSQL versions may handle protocol requests differently, detecting anomalies or unique response patterns helps in deducing the server version.

### Utilization of Known Vulnerabilities

Knowledge of version-specific vulnerabilities aids in confirming the server’s version by observing the impact of targeted exploit attempts.

- **Exploit Verification**: Deploy exploits from frameworks like Metasploit. An example command might include using a specific module with `msfconsole` to test known vulnerabilities:
  
  ```bash
  use exploit/windows/mssql/ms09_004_sp_replwritetovarbin
  set RHOST <target-ip>
  set RPORT 1433
  run
  ```

- **Fingerprinting with Tools**: Use additional fingerprinting scripts or tools that attempt various known version exploits and observe results for confirmation.

## Advanced Fingerprinting Techniques

### Database Metadata Exploration

Leveraging system databases and configurations can unveil explicit or implicit version details.

- **Metadata Queries**: Extract valuable version data using queries such as:

  ```sql
  SELECT name, compatibility_level FROM sys.databases;
  ```

  This reveals compatibility levels and, indirectly, the version features available.

- **Stored Procedures**: Test invocation of stored procedures that are distinct to certain MSSQL versions, thereby confirming the installed version.

### Comparison and Cross-verification

Consolidate findings through multiple methods to ensure a higher accuracy of your version determination.

- **Correlate Results**: By combining results from banner grabbing, SQL queries, error message evaluation, and exploit testing, create a comprehensive profile of the MSSQL server version.
  
- **Cross-reference with Released Changes**: Compare your findings with publicly available release notes and changelogs to spot unique features and behaviors linked to specific MSSQL versions.

## Integrating Findings into Attack Planning

Once version and feature details are obtained, integrate this knowledge into your offensive strategy:

- Focus exploit efforts on vulnerabilities specific to the identified MSSQL version.
- Structure SQL injection attacks with the awareness of version-specific syntax and feature sets.
- Evaluate privilege escalation possibilities considering the identified features and configuration options available in the target MSSQL environment.

Ensure that during detection and enumeration, your methods maintain a low footprint, minimizing detection risk by network defense systems while collecting the necessary intelligence for subsequent attack stages.
