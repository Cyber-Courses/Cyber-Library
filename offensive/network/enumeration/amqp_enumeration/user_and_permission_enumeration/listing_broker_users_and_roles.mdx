# Listing Broker Users and Roles

## Understanding Broker Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization in message brokers ensure that only verified users have access to resources and operations. These brokers typically use various authentication mechanisms, including username/password pairs, tokens, and certificates that conform to industry standards such as OAuth, LDAP, or TLS/SSL. Authentication ensures that only legitimate users can access brokered resources. Brokers implement authorization models that define specific access controls, determining what authenticated users are permitted to do. These permissions often include actions such as publishing, consuming, and configuring queues and exchanges. Prominent broker implementations, such as RabbitMQ and Apache ActiveMQ, support flexible authentication and authorization frameworks, allowing administrators to define granular access policies.

## Tools and Techniques for Enumerating Users

Enumerating users requires gaining insight into the credentials and roles defined within the broker. One effective method is utilizing the broker's management interfaces—many brokers offer web-based management consoles or command-line tools that provide administrative access to the list of users and their roles. Built-in broker commands, executed via command-line interfaces or management plugins, can help list users, provided appropriate permissions. Monitoring network traffic can also be effective; by capturing packets of AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) traffic between clients and brokers, it's possible to analyze authentication transactions and discern user identities and roles.

## Advanced User Enumeration with AMQP

Leveraging the AMQP protocol for enumeration involves crafting specific protocol messages to invoke responses from the broker that may disclose user information. This approach requires an understanding of AMQP command structures to forge messages aimed at exploring aspects of user configuration and roles. Additionally, intercepting AMQP command exchanges—capturing broker interactions—in real-time might reveal command metadata that designates legitimate users involved in the operation. Mastery of tools like Wireshark and broker-specific APIs is essential for this tactic to yield insightful details regarding user actions and interactions.

## Mapping Roles to Users

Mapping roles involves accessing the broker’s administrative tools or APIs to extract detailed information about each user and their assigned roles. This often includes examining configuration files or querying management plugins that maintain user-access logs. Cross-referencing this information against documented role-access policies is crucial for understanding how users are categorized and what specific permissions they possess. Recognizing the allocation of default system roles, such as superuser or admin underprivileged user roles, provides insight into potential escalation paths an attacker might exploit. 

## Bypassing Access Controls for Enumeration

Attackers may employ various techniques to bypass the broker's access controls during enumeration. This can include exploiting weak configurations in the broker's setup or discovering and leveraging default credentials. Misconfigured broker settings might allow unauthorized access to user listings and role definitions, thereby sidestepping purposeful access restrictions. Methods like input validation attacks or privilege escalation through known vulnerabilities further expand the attack surface for enumeration.

## Automation and Scripting for Enumerating Users and Roles

Automation scripts can systematically enumerate users and roles, making offensive operations scalable and efficient. Scripting languages such as Python can interface with broker API endpoints or management commands, automating the retrieval of user and role information. These scripts can be integrated into comprehensive penetration testing frameworks such as Metasploit or Burp Suite, enhancing the automation efforts by aligning enumeration practices with broader testing strategies.

## Reviewing Enumerated Data for Offensive Operations

After successfully enumerating users and roles, the information must be categorized based on access levels and privileges. High-privilege accounts, such as administrative users, represent prime targets for further exploitation due to their elevated permissions. Extracting and analyzing this data helps to plan subsequent attack vectors, such as privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration. Monitoring usage patterns and access logs during enumeration provides additional insight to identify potential security weaknesses that could facilitate offensive maneuvers.

## Post-Enumeration Activities

Trust-based relationships and access hierarchies derived from user-role mappings can inform post-enumeration approaches. Correlating the acquired data with other intelligence gathered—such as network vulnerabilities, architectural topology, and connected systems—enables the identification of systemic dependencies and potential security gaps that might be exploited. Constructing a detailed profile of enumerated users aids in architecting tailored attack scenarios, allowing pinpoint attacks on strategic assets informed by the specific privileges conferred by enumerated roles.
