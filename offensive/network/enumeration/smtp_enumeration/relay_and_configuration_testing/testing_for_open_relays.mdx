# Testing for Open Relays

## Purpose of Open Relay Testing

Open relay testing focuses on identifying SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) servers that permit relaying of email messages without proper authorization or authentication. Open relays are SMTP servers configured to process email from any source and direct it to another destination. Insecurely configured relays can be abused by spammers and malicious actors to distribute spam, phishing emails, or malware. Identifying and securing open relays is thus crucial for maintaining secure email operations and organizational reputation.

Proper open relay testing can distinguish between legitimate relay use cases, where specific configurations allow relaying for authorized users, and accidental configurations exposing systems to unauthorized use. Understanding the outcomes of these tests is vital to ensuring SMTP services are not misused, thereby preventing server blacklisting and maintaining email delivery efficacy.

## Tools and Techniques for Open Relay Testing

### Command-Line Utilities

Manual tools such as `telnet` and `nc` (netcat) help in direct interaction with SMTP services for open relay testing. These utilities allow testers to manually craft SMTP sessions and verify if an SMTP server permits relaying of messages to non-local domains. An example method using `telnet` can include the following steps:

```bash
telnet smtp.example.com 25
```

1. Initiate a SMTP session.

```bash
EHLO attacker.com
MAIL FROM:<attacker@attacker.com>
RCPT TO:<victim@victim.com>
DATA
```

2. Send commands to initiate sending an email.

By analyzing server responses to these handcrafted sessions, testers can identify if the server permits unrestricted email forwarding.

For automation, `swaks` (Swiss Army Knife for SMTP) facilitates scripted SMTP session testing. It allows sending customizable email formats and automates checking of SMTP relay responses, significantly speeding up the testing process.

### Automated Tools

Nmap offers a feature-rich scripting engine allowing for automated scanning of SMTP configurations. Deploying scripts such as `smtp-open-relay` can efficiently test if an SMTP server is an open relay:

```bash
nmap --script smtp-open-relay -p 25,465,587 [target host]
```

Similarly, the Metasploit Framework includes modules specifically targeting SMTP services to identify open relay vulnerabilities. By setting appropriate parameters and executing the module, testers can automate open relay checks across multiple targets, thus improving coverage and efficiency.

## Testing Methodology

### Identifying Target SMTP Servers

The initial phase involves discovering potential targets within the network that host SMTP services. Tools like `Nmap` effectively scan and map network segments to identify hosts with open ports typically used by SMTP: 25, 465, and 587.

```bash
nmap -p 25,465,587 -sV [network range]
```

This scan helps compile a list of SMTP servers warranting further evaluation for open relay vulnerabilities.

### Establishing SMTP Communication

After identifying SMTP targets, testers engage with the server using EHLO or HELO commands. Approaching this carefully ensures minimal disruption and reduces the risk of alerting monitoring systems to potentially intrusive activity. Initial commands like `EHLO` help establish the legitimacy of the interaction, proceeding to the relay testing only after confirming a stable server communication.

### Performing Relay Tests

This involves crafting and sending test emails from non-local addresses to non-local recipients. The aim is to test if an unauthorized client can relay messages using the servers:

1. Use `MAIL FROM:` to specify a sender from external domains.
2. Use `RCPT TO:` to specify a recipient not part of the SMTP serverâ€™s local domain.

The server's responses will confirm whether it acts as a relay. Servers properly configured should reject mail that attempts to use the server as a relay without authentication.

## Analyzing and Documenting Test Results

### Interpretation of Outcomes

Responses from SMTP servers during these tests form the basis of vulnerability assessment. Open relay acceptance ("250 OK") from unauthorized email domains signals a serious misconfiguration, whereas rejections (e.g., "550 Relaying denied") are indications of secure configurations restricting relay.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

Post-analysis, presenting findings involves documenting configuration flaws, associated risks, and recommended remediation steps. Comprehensive reports should prioritize security reconfigurations such as enabling authentication mechanisms and updating the relay settings to limit use to legitimate users only. This actionable guidance aids in closing open relay vulnerabilities, thereby preserving the integrity and reputation of organizational email systems.
