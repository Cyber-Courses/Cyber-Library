### Identifying Open SMTP Ports (25, 465, 587)

Efficient identification of open SMTP ports is a critical component of offensive cybersecurity operations, providing valuable insight into the network's email infrastructure. The ports typically used for SMTP services are 25, 465, and 587, each serving different roles in email transmission and security protocols.

#### Understanding SMTP Ports

- **Port 25**: The default port for SMTP communication. It is primarily used for communication between SMTP servers.
- **Port 465**: Originally a port for SMTPS, port 465 is now used for SMTP over SSL. Though deprecated for SMTP, some legacy systems and configurations might still employ it.
- **Port 587**: The default port for SMTP submission, used by mail clients to send emails to mail servers with optional encryption through STARTTLS.

#### Nmap for SMTP Port Scanning

Nmap is a robust tool for identifying open ports and determining service information. Initiating a scan with Nmap is straightforward and can be tailored for efficiency.

- **Basic Scans**:
  - To scan specifically for SMTP ports, use:
    ```bash
    nmap -p 25,465,587 <target-IP>
    ```
  - This command checks the specified ports on the target IP address.

- **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)**:
  - NSE can gather additional information about the SMTP service by running pre-defined scripts.
  - Example command:
    ```bash
    nmap -p 25,465,587 --script smtp-open-relay.nse <target-IP>
    ```

#### Masscan Utilization

Masscan operates similarly to Nmap but is designed for lightning-fast scans of large networks.

- Set up Masscan to scan SMTP ports with a command like:
  ```bash
  masscan -p25,465,587 <target-subnet> --max-rate 1000
  ```

- Configure the `--max-rate` to control the scan speed, which affects network load and detection risk.

#### Nc (Netcat) for Manual Verification

Netcat, or `nc`, is a versatile tool that can be used to manually verify whether an SMTP port is open or closed by attempting to establish a connection.

- Use Netcat to connect to an SMTP port:
  ```bash
  nc -vz <target-IP> 25
  ```

- This command checks for a verbose connection while performing a zero-I/O mode check on port 25. The response will confirm if the port is open.

#### Strategic Execution

**Stealth and Evasion Techniques**

- Adjust Nmap’s timing using `-T` option for slower scans to reduce the likelihood of detection:
  ```bash
  nmap -p 25,465,587 -T2 <target-IP>
  ```
- Randomize scan order and use IP spoofing or VPN tunnels to obscure origin.

**Prioritization Based on Infrastructure**

- Focus efforts on likely network segments—such as those hosting mail servers.

**Automated Scripting for Repeated Tasks**

- Construct scripts that use tools like Nmap or Masscan to schedule regular scans.
- Use cron jobs in Unix-like systems to automate scripts for periodic execution.

#### Analyzing Scan Results

After conducting scans, thorough analysis is essential for refining offensive strategies.

- **Verification of Open Ports**:
  - Cross-verify with an alternative tool to confirm bypassing firewalls or network security systems.
  - Look for discrepancies or signs indicating network security measures or configuration errors.

- **Triaging Relevant Targets**:
  - Filter out results to focus on targets that hold email-forwarding or transmitting roles exclusively.
  - Document findings meticulously to aid in subsequent phases like software/version detection.

#### Integration with Broader Tactics

Identify potential SMTP ports as a preliminary stage before further enumeration, like detecting server software and versions. This integration forms a comprehensive methodological approach, positioning the operator to exploit potential vulnerabilities within the SMTP infrastructure. Scanning scripts, result analysis, and follow-up enumeration combine to prepare for targeted exploitation efforts, enhancing overall attack efficacy.
