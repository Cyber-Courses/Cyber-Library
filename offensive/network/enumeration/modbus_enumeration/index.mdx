## Modbus Enumeration

### [Service and Version Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/service_and_version_detection)

Service and version detection in Modbus enumeration is essential to understand the communication dynamics and specific characteristics of devices on the network. Modbus is commonly used in industrial control systems, and identifying the Modbus service presents an entry point for potential exploits.

- #### [Identifying Modbus Protocol](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/service_and_version_detection/identifying_modbus_protocol/)
  
  To identify Modbus protocol services, tools such as Nmap with the appropriate scripts (e.g., `nmap -p 502 --script modbus-discover <target_IP>`) can be employed to detect the presence of Modbus TCP services. This detection is critical for determining the devices that communicate using the Modbus protocol, pinpointing potential targets for deeper exploration.

- #### [Detecting Supported Modbus Functions](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/service_and_version_detection/detecting_supported_modbus_functions/)
  
  Understanding which Modbus function codes a device supports can reveal vulnerabilities and avenues for exploitation. Tools like modscan can query devices for supported function codes, providing a landscape of capabilities that can be leveraged in attack scenarios.

### [Device and Register Mapping](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/device_and_register_mapping)

Mapping devices and registers within a Modbus network helps in assessing the control landscape and identifying critical data points that could be disrupted or leveraged. This step is foundational for Modbus security testing.

- #### [Enumerating Device IDs and Endpoints](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/device_and_register_mapping/enumerating_device_ids_and_endpoints/)

  Enumerating device IDs involves identifying all endpoints that are expecting commands or transmitting data over the Modbus network. This can be achieved through manual inspection or automated queries using tools like `modpoll` to gather a list of active Modbus device IDs.

- #### [Mapping Registers for Device Control](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/device_and_register_mapping/mapping_registers_for_device_control/)

  Register mapping involves discovering read/write points in a device's memory area. Using tools such as `mbtget`, an attacker can map out the memory registers to understand what data each register controls or holds, allowing for manipulation of device behavior or data.

### [Function Code Analysis](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/function_code_analysis)

Function codes in Modbus communication are critical as they define operations like reading and writing data. A thorough analysis of these codes is crucial to understanding a target systemâ€™s operational logic and potential vulnerabilities.

- #### [Identifying Read/Write Function Codes](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/function_code_analysis/identifying_readwrite_function_codes/)
  
  By analyzing read and write function codes, practitioners can determine how data is transferred or altered in a system. Tools can simulate these commands to understand which areas of a system are exposed to unauthorized reading or manipulation.

- #### [Discovering Diagnostic and Exception Codes](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/function_code_analysis/discovering_diagnostic_and_exception_codes/)

  Discovering diagnostic and exception codes can expose how devices handle errors or specific conditions. By probing these codes, particular operational weaknesses can be identified, showcasing how an adversary might exploit error-handling processes or bypass certain protections.

### [Slave ID Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/slave_id_enumeration)

In Modbus networks, devices are often assigned unique Slave IDs. Enumerating these IDs is crucial for a comprehensive view of network topology and connectivity, providing insight necessary for lateral movement or targeted attacks.

- #### [Identifying Connected Devices by Slave ID](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/slave_id_enumeration/identifying_connected_devices_by_slave_id/)
  
  Identifying connected devices involves querying the network for Slave IDs using scatter-shot approaches or systematic tools like `modscan`. These Slave IDs help in painting a picture of the connected device ecosystem and highlight potential targets for further exploitation.

- #### [Mapping Device Roles Using Slave IDs](offensive/network/enumeration/modbus_enumeration/slave_id_enumeration/mapping_device_roles_using_slave_ids/)

  By analyzing Slave IDs, practitioners can infer the roles and importance of each device within a network. This understanding facilitates accurate targeting decisions, such as selecting high-value devices for further manipulation or attack planning based on device criticality and function within the network.
