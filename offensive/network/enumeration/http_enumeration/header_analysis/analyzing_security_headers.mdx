## Analyzing Security Headers

### Identifying Security Headers
Security headers are crucial HTTP response components that dictate how browsers should interact with the web server and manage the data. These headers provide fundamental protective mechanisms ensuring that common web vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking, are mitigated. 

Common security headers include:

- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: This header forces browsers to only interact with a website using HTTPS, mitigating the risks associated with man-in-the-middle attacks. It is defined by `Strict-Transport-Security` with values like `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`.
  
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: It helps control resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page, reducing risks of XSS attacks. A typical CSP might look like `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com`.
  
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: This header is used to prevent MIME type sniffing. Setting it to `nosniff` tells the browser not to override the response’s content type.
  
- **X-Frame-Options**: This anti-clickjacking header restricts how your site can be framed by other sites. Its values can be `DENY`, `SAMEORIGIN`, or `ALLOW-FROM uri`.
  
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Although deprecated in the modern web capable of employing CSP, this header enabled built-in cross-site scripting filters in browsers when it was in practice, by setting it to `1; mode=block`.

### Tools for Security Header Analysis
Analyzing security headers effectively requires a mix of manual inspection and automated tools. Various methods and tools can be leveraged for extracting and examining these headers:

- **Browser Extensions**: Extensions like "HTTP Headers" or "SecurityHeaders.io" can be plugged into browsers to inspect headers during server communication. These provide a quick overview and are useful during the initial walkthrough of the site's security posture.
  
- **Command Line Tools**: `curl` is invaluable for manually retrieving headers in the command line: `curl -I http://example.com`. For more comprehensive analysis, tools like `Nikto` or `Nmap` can be used to scan websites for header information: `nikto -h http://example.com` or `nmap --script http-headers http://example.com`.

### Analyzing Header Configurations
Effectively parsing and evaluating HTTP security headers begins with understanding their configurations and effects on web security.

- **Parsing Header Data**: Use tools to retrieve headers and manually inspect them for expected directives and policies. For instance, analyze CSP directives to ensure only intended resources are allowed.

- **Assessing Header Effectiveness**: Compare actual header configurations against security best practices. Determine if headers like HSTS are adequately configured with high `max-age` values and covering all subdomains (`includeSubDomains`).

### Exploiting Weaknesses in Security Headers
Numerous websites either omit crucial security headers or misconfigure them, leaving doors open for potential exploits.

- **Missing Headers**: A lack of critical headers like CSP or HSTS often indicates vulnerabilities such as susceptibility to protocol downgrade attacks.
  
- **Misconfigured Headers**: Headers set with overly permissive values, such as weak CSP policies (`script-src *`), can expose applications to script injection attacks. Security assessments should highlight these weaknesses.

### Evading Security Header Protections
Certain header protections can be bypassed by attackers who exploit negligent configurations or limitations.

- **Bypassing X-Content-Type-Options**: Some browsers may still sniff the MIME type under specific conditions, which can be leveraged through crafted payloads.
  
- **Disabling Content Security Policies**: Attackers might exploit the ‘unsafe-inline’ source directive within CSP or inject scripts through other mistakenly trusted domains included in the script-src directive.

### Countermeasures Evaluation
After identifying vulnerabilities associated with HTTP security headers, recommendations and mitigations should be applied and tested.

- **Recommendations for Improving Header Security**: Implement robust policies, e.g., strict `Content-Security-Policy` configurations, enforce `Strict-Transport-Security` with suitable max-age, and ensuring `X-Content-Type-Options` is set to `nosniff`.
  
- **Testing After Mitigations**: Continuously reevaluate the efficacy of security headers using automated scanners and vulnerability assessment tools to validate their configurations and ensure no regressions occur in security posture.
