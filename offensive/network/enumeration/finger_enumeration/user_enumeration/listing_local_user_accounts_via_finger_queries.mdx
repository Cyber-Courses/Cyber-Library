# Listing Local User Accounts via Finger Queries

## Understanding the Finger Protocol

The Finger protocol is an early networking utility designed to report information about users on a networked system. It operates as a query-response protocol, where a query is sent to a server, and information about users is returned. This typically includes login names, full names, idle times, login times, and potentially the user's plan and project files. Understanding this outwardly simple protocol is crucial to leveraging it effectively for user enumeration.

### Protocol Operation Overview

Finger protocol operates over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) typically on port 79. When a request is made to the server on this port, it might return information about users. The syntax of the request is quite straightforward: you either request information about a specific username or about all users by issuing a blank query. The server then responds with information according to configuration and permissions set by the system administrator.

### Network Port and Configuration Considerations

Configuration is essential when assessing the enumeration potential of the Finger protocol. Variations in settings can lead to significant differences in the information returned. While the protocol typically uses TCP port 79, security measures such as port redirection or restriction may require additional reconnaissance to identify the correct listening port. Understanding these configurations can help pinpoint possible entryways for user enumeration and identify misconfigured servers that could inadvertently expose sensitive user details.

## Constructing Effective Finger Queries

Identification of valid user accounts using the Finger protocol demands precise query construction.

### Query Formulation Tactics

Crafting queries involves utilizing appropriate syntax for targeting specific or general user information retrieval. For instance, querying a specific username can involve a command format such as:

```shell
finger username@hostname
```

Sending a blank query (e.g., `finger @hostname`) might list all users in some less secure configurations. Differentiating between these types allows operators to target queries based on the protocol's behavior on specific systems to optimize the amount of information revealed in the responses.

### Batch Query Strategies

To conduct queries at scale, especially when attempting to enumerate an organization’s user database, automation is often necessary. Scripting languages like Python can be used to issue multiple queries, either in parallel or in a staggered fashion to avoid detection. Tools such as `curl` can also be scripted to automate this task. An example of batch scripting in Python might use a loop to repeatedly send Finger requests for a list of usernames.

```python
import os

usernames = ['user1', 'user2', 'user3']
hostname = 'example.com'

for user in usernames:
    os.system(f"finger {user}@{hostname}")
```

This script sends individual notifications for each user listed, collecting responses autonomously.

## Response Analysis and Data Parsing

Analyzing responses from Finger queries is critical for extracting valuable user information effectively.

### Identifying Key User Information

Finger responses may vary in format but often include usernames, login times, terminal names, and idle times. Focusing on these fields can provide insights into user activity and validity. Recognizing patterns such as frequent login fluctuations or prolonged idle times can help verify the existence and usage patterns of specific accounts.

### Pattern Recognition in Responses

Using regular expressions (regex) can simplify the extraction of relevant information from Finger responses. Automating the parsing process will enhance efficiency, particularly when dealing with a significant volume of data. Tools like `grep` combined with regex can directly filter critical details from the output.

Example command:

```shell
finger @hostname | grep -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@'
```

This command extracts lines with usernames in typical email format from a global Finger query result.

## Bypassing Security Measures

Understanding and circumventing security mechanisms is integral in executing Finger queries without interruption.

### Firewall and IDS Evasion

Most modern environments deploy firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that can detect and block Finger queries. Bypassing these requires techniques such as using non-standard ports or blending query patterns to evade detection. Techniques such as obfuscating query traffic with VPNs or proxies might also be effective in avoiding security mechanisms focused on traditional Finger requests.

### Addressing Protocol Misconfigurations

Servers can sometimes be found with misconfigured Finger implementations that leave them vulnerable to exploitation for enumeration purposes. By identifying and targeting these misconfigurations, one can potentially bypass security configurations. Utilizing reconnaissance to uncover system misconfigurations enhances the probability of successful enumeration.

## Automation and Tool Utilization

Automation can significantly streamline the process of conducting Finger enumeration.

### Utilizing Existing Enumeration Tools

Several tools are available for automating Finger queries, such as `rpcinfo`, which often includes plugins for Finger or suites like `metasploit`. These tools carry options to customize query formats, destinations, and reporting.

Tool command example:

```shell
rpcinfo –a hostname –p 79
```

This command scans for Finger services operating on the designated host to facilitate the enumeration.

### Custom Scripting for Finger Enumeration

Where existing tools are insufficient, or network architecture demands customization, custom scripts can be employed. Using Python, one can build comprehensive enumeration scripts to enumerate and parse data consistently, improving both precision and safety of operation.

## Maintaining Operational Security

Preserving operational security and minimizing detection likelihood during Finger enumeration is critical.

### Avoiding Detection during Enumeration

By modulating the speed of queries, rotating source IP addresses, and randomizing query patterns, detection by monitoring systems can be minimized. Employing low, consistent query volumes with varied intervals helps blend enumeration traffic into legitimate network activity.

### Logging and Masking Techniques

Modern environments often deploy increased logging measures. Using network anonymization services or proxies can prevent logging mechanisms from easily attributing Finger queries to an originating source. Employing these techniques effectively masks enumeration activities and enhances operational security during user enumeration.
