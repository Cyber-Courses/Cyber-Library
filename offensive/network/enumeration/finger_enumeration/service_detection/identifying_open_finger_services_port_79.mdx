### Identifying Open Finger Services (Port 79)

Port 79 is traditionally used by the Finger protocol, a service for querying user information on a network. Identifying open Finger services is a key step in network enumeration and can provide critical insights into available user accounts and other information. Offensive cybersecurity practitioners often exploit this protocol due to its tendency to expose sensitive information without substantial access restrictions.

#### Port Scanning for Finger

To detect open Finger services, the initial step is typically a comprehensive port scan focused on identifying systems listening on TCP port 79. By pinpointing systems that provide this service, attackers can narrow their focus and perform more targeted reconnaissance activities.

##### Strategy and Tools

Nmap, a versatile network scanning tool, is frequently employed to identify open ports, including port 79. The specific command for scanning a network for open Finger ports might look like this:

```bash
nmap -p 79 192.168.1.0/24
```

Here, `-p 79` specifies a scan of port 79, and `192.168.1.0/24` denotes the target network range. The output of this command will reveal any devices with port 79 open, indicating the potential presence of a Finger service.

Automated port scan scripts can enhance the efficiency of these operations, particularly against large networks. Scripting languages like Python or Bash can be used to automate Nmap scans, scheduling them or logging their outputs for subsequent analysis.

##### Analyzing Network Traffic

For finer control and to circumvent detection, analyzing network traffic to identify Finger service signatures can be invaluable. Tools like Wireshark can capture and filter traffic to pinpoint communications typical of the Finger protocol. When analyzing packets, look for cleartext requests and responses characteristic of the Finger protocol. 

```
tcp.port == 79
```

The above display filter in Wireshark can be used to isolate traffic related specifically to the Finger service, allowing for deeper inspection of data flow and potential user enumeration.

#### Finger Service Enumeration

Once open Finger services are identified, the next phase involves performing active enumeration to gather as much user account information as exposed by the protocol.

##### Active Enumeration Steps

Enumeration via the Finger service involves sending a query to obtain user information. A simple manual query might use telnet:

```bash
telnet target_ip 79
user
```

Replace `user` with an actual username to request information about that user. The response may include usernames, full names, home directories, shell access details, and potentially finger status messages.

##### Leveraging Custom Scripts for Enumeration

For bulk enumeration, custom scripts can significantly expedite the process. These scripts can iterate over a list of common usernames, sending queries against the Finger service and collecting any information returned. A Python-based example might utilize sockets to interface with the service:

```python
import socket

def finger_query(host, user):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect((host, 79))
    sock.sendall(f"{user}\n".encode('utf-8'))
    response = sock.recv(4096).decode('utf-8')
    sock.close()
    return response

# Example usage
print(finger_query('192.168.1.100', 'user'))
```

This code establishes a connection to a target host on port 79 and sends a Finger query for the specified user, outputting any response received.

#### Bypassing Network Filters

Network protection methods like firewalls can hinder direct engagement with Finger services. Understanding and applying techniques for evading such defenses can maintain effective enumeration.

##### Evasion Techniques

Altering the structure of Finger queries or segmenting requests into fragmented packets are common evasion techniques. These methods aim to bypass simplistic filtering rules set on network devices. Tailored query crafting ensures that the payloads remain under the radar while still achieving their intended purpose.

##### Using Proxy and Tunneling Strategies

Engagement through proxy or VPN can further anonymize operations. SSH or VPN tunneling offers not only concealment but can also bypass network-level restrictions, redirecting traffic through less monitored network paths. Establishing a proxy connection or VPN session before initiating Finger queries ensures that tracebacks are significantly more challenging.

#### Exploiting Finger Vulnerabilities

Despite being a simple protocol, the Finger service can be fraught with vulnerabilities, especially if the service implementation is outdated or misconfigured.

##### Buffer Overflow Attacks

Some older Finger server implementations are susceptible to buffer overflow attacks, which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code. Identifying such vulnerabilities often involves researching known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) relevant to the Finger service and testing these against the target.

##### Protocol Misuse

Natural misuse characteristics of the Finger protocol are often leveraged for extended information disclosure. Effective misuse involves deliberately querying for common names or leveraging default usernames to enumerate accounts. This can provide attackers with crucial data for the next phases of an attack lifecycle.

The strategies outlined above require precise execution, paperwork, and continuous refinement as network landscapes evolve and defensive measures advance. Each successful enumeration via the Finger protocol paves the way for deeper penetration activities within the target environment.
