# Finger Enumeration

Finger Enumeration techniques enable security professionals to gather detailed information about users, services, and hosts by interacting with the traditional Finger service. This section delves into the methodologies and tools used for effective Finger enumeration.

## [Service Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/finger_enumeration/service_detection)

### [Identifying Open Finger Services (Port 79)](offensive/network/enumeration/finger_enumeration/service_detection/identifying_open_finger_services_port_79/)

Identifying open Finger services involves scanning for open TCP port 79, which is the default port for the Finger protocol. Tools like `nmap` can be utilized for this purpose. Running a command such as `nmap -p 79 <target>` helps in quickly determining if the Finger service is operational on a remote host. Correlating the presence of this open port with other network indicators can also provide insights into potential Finger service deployment.

### [Detecting Finger Server Implementations](offensive/network/enumeration/finger_enumeration/service_detection/detecting_finger_server_implementations/)

Once a Finger service is identified, detecting its specific implementation can reveal the type of server software and its configuration features. This can be achieved by performing banner grabbing, either manually or with tools like `netcat`, `nc <target> 79`, to simply connect and query the service. The response may indicate the version of the server software, providing a potential avenue to uncover known vulnerabilities or behaviors associated with that implementation.

## [User Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/finger_enumeration/user_enumeration)

### [Listing Local User Accounts via Finger Queries](offensive/network/enumeration/finger_enumeration/user_enumeration/listing_local_user_accounts_via_finger_queries/)

A primary objective in Finger enumeration is to list user accounts available on a target system. Constructing queries to the Finger service can return information on active or configured user accounts. Using command-line tools like `finger @<target>`, attackers can retrieve a list of user accounts and potentially each user's home directories, shells, and more, which can be useful for planning further penetration activities.

### [Correlating Finger Responses to Active Users](offensive/network/enumeration/finger_enumeration/user_enumeration/correlating_finger_responses_to_active_users/)

Analyzing the data retrieved from Finger service responses can help correlate user account information to active users. This involves interpreting meta-information such as the last login time or current session status, if available. Data correlation can be automated using scripts that process and aggregate responses from multiple queries to identify patterns and relationships within the user data on the target system.

## [Host Information Gathering](offensive/network/enumeration/finger_enumeration/host_information_gathering)

### [Extracting Hostnames and Associated Users](offensive/network/enumeration/finger_enumeration/host_information_gathering/extracting_hostnames_and_associated_users/)

Finger responses can be leveraged to extract hostnames and associated user information, offering insights into the architecture and structure of the network environment. By querying known hostnames or IP ranges, professionals can build a map of hosts involved, aided by the user data and potentially revealing shared services or clustering of resources based on user assignments.

### [Identifying Uptime and Login Information](offensive/network/enumeration/finger_enumeration/host_information_gathering/identifying_uptime_and_login_information/)

In addition to user and service information, the Finger protocol can sometimes reveal uptime and login details of specific hosts. By querying the Finger service, metadata about the system's operational state—such as last boot time, current session times, and duration—can be captured. This data is essential for understanding the resilience and maintenance scheduling of a network, allowing for more precisely timed follow-up attacks or reconnaissance activities.
