# Identifying Open InfluxDB Ports (Default 8086)

Identifying open ports, especially the default InfluxDB port (8086), is a critical step in the offensive cybersecurity process. It involves scanning network boundaries to pinpoint open services that might offer avenues for entry or further exploration.

## Network Scanning Techniques

### Nmap Port Scanning

Nmap is a versatile tool widely used for network discovery and security auditing. To identify open InfluxDB ports, Nmap's TCP connect and SYN scan are effective. The following command illustrates a typical Nmap execution for detecting the default InfluxDB port:

```bash
nmap -p 8086 -sS -T4 <target_ip_range>
```

This command performs a SYN scan (`-sS`) on port 8086, with timing set to `T4` for faster execution across a specified IP range. Additionally, Nmap’s scripting engine can be used for deeper detection:

```bash
nmap -p 8086 --script=influxdb-script <target_ip>
```

This command triggers a specific script that might be tailored to detect InfluxDB running over the identified port.

### Masscan for Large Landscapes

Masscan is known for its high-speed scanning capabilities, ideal for large IP ranges. Configuring Masscan to scan for InfluxDB’s default port efficiently is accomplished as follows:

```bash
masscan -p 8086 --rate 10000 --range <ip_range>
```

This setup scans the given IP range at a rate of 10,000 packets per second. The output, although less detailed than Nmap, provides swift insight into open ports.

## Advanced Scanning Tools

### Zmap for Fast Scanning

Zmap, like Masscan, is optimized for internet-wide scanning. Its capability of narrowing down open ports to specific services puts it in favorable light for large sweep operations:

```bash
zmap -p 8086 -o results.json <target_ip_range>
```

The output result in JSON format allows for easier post-processing, filtering through open ports, specifically zeroing in on InfluxDB.

## Identifying Non-Standard Port Configurations

### Custom Port Assessments

Not all InfluxDB instances run on the default port 8086. Therefore, the exploration for non-standard ports may be necessary. This involves leveraging tools that support service fingerprinting. For instance, Nmap’s service detection capabilities:

```bash
nmap -p- --open -sV --script=influxdb-script <target_ip>
```

Here, the scan is conducted across all ports (`-p-`) to identify services that match the InfluxDB fingerprint.

## Evading Detection During Scans

### Bypassing Network Defenses

To remain undetected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS), one must consider altering scan patterns. This can be achieved by reducing the scan speed:

```bash
nmap -p 8086 --scan-delay 200ms <target_ip_range>
```

Incorporating delays helps evade network defenses and decreases the likelihood of being detected and blocked by rate limiters.

## Post-Detection Verification

### Banner Grabbing

Verifying that detected ports actually serve InfluxDB involves banner grabbing. Tools like Netcat can be utilized:

```bash
echo 'GET / HTTP/1.0' | nc <target_ip> 8086
```

Upon capturing the response, one can infer service details that confirm an InfluxDB presence.

### Service Fingerprinting

Tools such as `nmap` with the version detection (`-sV`) and use of external fingerprint databases can refine results, portraying accurate service details:

```bash
nmap -p 8086 -sV --version-intensity 5 <target_ip>
```

This command aims for a high fingerprinting intensity, challenging the service to reveal its identity.

## Automation and Scripting

### Scripting with Python

Python can automate port detection tasks, parsing outputs for large networks. The following script snippet demonstrates basic automation:

```python
import subprocess

def scan_influxdb_ports(ip_range):
    result = subprocess.run(['nmap', '-p', '8086', '-sS', ip_range], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout

ip_range = '192.168.1.0/24'
print(scan_influxdb_ports(ip_range))
```

This script runs an Nmap scan on a specified IP range and prints the resulting output, expediently summarizing status results.

## Integrating Results with Further Enumeration

### Linking Port Detection to InfluxDB Version and Features

After successfully detecting open ports, the next logical step is to transition into deeper enumeration. Consolidating findings with associated InfluxDB version and feature identification enriches the reconnaissance dossier. This can involve querying databases using identified credentials or leveraging other enumeration scripts to uncover supported InfluxDB features.
