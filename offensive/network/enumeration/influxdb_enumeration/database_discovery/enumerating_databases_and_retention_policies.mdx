# Enumerating Databases and Retention Policies

## Database Enumeration Techniques

### Command Line Enumeration
Command-line tools are pivotal in conducting effective database enumeration within InfluxDB. The primary tool used is the InfluxDB Command-Line Interface (CLI), which facilitates direct interaction with the database to gather information on existing databases. By executing commands like `SHOW DATABASES`, operators can list all accessible databases. In practice, the command executed would look like:

```bash
influx -execute "SHOW DATABASES"
```

This approach is direct and efficient for initial reconnaissance. Once databases are enumerated, their properties and contents can be further explored to assess potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

### Querying System Tables
InfluxDB system tables offer a robust mechanism for drilling down into the database structure without direct command-line access, enabling strategic reconnaissance. Queries targeting specific system tables can extract information about the databases, including names and attributes. A typical query might involve:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "system"."databases"
```

This operation requires an understanding of how InfluxDB organizes its metadata and can be exceptionally useful in environments where command-line access is restricted or monitored.

### Network Traffic Analysis
Network traffic analysis serves as an indirect method for database enumeration, especially useful when direct interaction with the database is not feasible. By capturing and analyzing traffic using tools like Wireshark, you can inspect communications between the database and its clients, discerning databases from the context of transmitted data. Network patterns and specific protocols can inadvertently reveal database names and even login attempts, hinting at potential access points.

### Exploiting Configuration Leaks
Configuration files, often overlooked, can be a rich source of database information. Misconfigured or exposed configuration files on servers can leak valuable details about database names and connection strings. Tools like grep and automated scanners can search through distributed file systems for configuration files containing database references. An example command might be:

```bash
grep -r "database_name" /etc/influxdb/
```

Finding such leaks requires creativity and persistence but can yield significant access advantages if configuration errors exist.

## Retention Policies Enumeration Strategies

### API Endpoint Exploitation
InfluxDB exposes certain functionalities through its REST API, which can be exploited to gather information on retention policies. By systematically exploring these endpoints, offensive operators can retrieve retention policies using crafted API calls. A typical exploitation command through an API might be:

```bash
curl -G http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode "q=SHOW RETENTION POLICIES ON <database_name>"
```

This requires knowledge of the API's structure and authentication schema. 

### Retention Policy Queries
Directly querying retention policies involves executing commands specifically designed to expose their configurations. The `SHOW RETENTION POLICIES` command returns critical metadata about how long and where the data is retained. Utilizing this command within the CLI looks like:

```bash
influx -execute "SHOW RETENTION POLICIES ON <database_name>"
```

These queries provide comprehensive information on data longevity and storage methodologies, informing subsequent attack strategies.

### Brute Force Techniques
Brute force enumeration involves automating requests to potential retention policies, akin to password cracking. By automating the process of attempting various retention policy names or configurations, hidden policies might be discovered. Tools for performing these tasks can be bespoke scripts or modifications of existing network tools to suit the specificity of InfluxDB enumeration.

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining Enumeration with Lateral Movement
Once databases and retention policies are mapped, the information can fuel further penetration efforts. Lateral movement involves using details from the enumeration to access other databases, escalate privileges, or access sensitive data. This often involves chaining smaller vulnerabilities compounded by the intel gathered from the enumeration process.

### Cross-Referencing with Historical Data
Historical data provides context that can enrich enumeration findings. By analyzing data over time, operators can detect changes in retention policies or the appearance of new databases, suggesting potential new attack vectors or shifts in organizational priorities.

### Automating Enumeration Scripts
Automation enhances precision and efficiency. By crafting scripts that execute enumeration commands, an operator ensures repeatability and reduces human error. Scripts written in Python or Bash can encapsulate multiple enumeration techniques, conducting a comprehensive sweep in one go.

### Evading Detection During Enumeration
Stealth is vital during enumeration. Techniques such as adjusting network traffic patterns to mimic legitimate user actions or employing randomized timing for queries reduce the chance of detection. Operators may employ low-and-slow strategies to further minimize the visibility of their actions.

By comprehensively understanding and applying these techniques, offensive security professionals can effectively enumerate databases and retention policies, setting the stage for deeper infiltration and exploitation activities.
