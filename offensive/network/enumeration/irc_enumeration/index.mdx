# IRC Enumeration

## [Service and Version Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/irc_enumeration/service_and_version_detection)

Service and version detection in IRC enumeration involves accurately identifying the IRC server being used and determining its version. The goal is to gather as much information as possible to understand the server's capabilities and potential vulnerabilities.

One effective technique for detecting IRC services is through the use of network scanning tools like Nmap. With Nmap, you can perform service identification using the `-sV` option, which helps in determining the version of the services running on open ports. For example:

```bash
nmap -sV -p 6660-7000 <target_ip>
```

Banner grabbing is another method where the banner or welcome message displayed by the server is extracted. This often includes server name and version. Telnet or Netcat can be used to connect to the IRC service and retrieve the banner data.

Fingerprinting IRC servers using custom scripts allows for more precise detection, potentially identifying patches or specific configurations. Scripts can automate the process, parsing version information and comparing it with known vulnerabilities from databases, aiding in risk assessment.

## [Server and Channel Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/irc_enumeration/server_and_channel_enumeration)

Server and channel enumeration involves discovering and crawling through IRC networks to map out servers and their associated channels, gaining insights into the structure and activity.

To discover IRC servers within a network, tools like `masscan` can be employed to quickly identify open IRC ports. Followed by connecting to these servers to obtain server lists and metadata using IRC client tools or scripts.

Automated tools for IRC channel discovery help in listing available channels without manual navigation. For stealthier operations, tools can be modified to mimic IRC client behavior closely, avoiding detection and logging. 

- [Listing Available Channels](offensive/network/enumeration/irc_enumeration/server_and_channel_enumeration/listing_available_channels/): This process involves using IRC commands such as `LIST` to retrieve the list of channels available on a server. Special attention must be given to channels with restrictive names or hidden channels.

Regular analysis of IRC channel structure and permissions is also vital. Channels can have special modes and restrictions, revealing operational procedures and potential entry points.

- [Identifying Active Users in Channels](offensive/network/enumeration/irc_enumeration/server_and_channel_enumeration/identifying_active_users_in_channels/): Exploring ways to enumerate active users within channels, an attacker can leverage IRC commands like `NAMES` to list users and understand participant dynamics.

## [Gathering Server Information](offensive/network/enumeration/irc_enumeration/gathering_server_information)

Gathering server information aims to extract configuration details and server-specific data, often overlooked yet crucial for comprehensive understanding.

To extract detailed IRC server configuration info, one might look at "server rules" and supported commands. These rules, often presented during connection, can be parsed to gauge server restrictions and capabilities.

- [Server Rules and Supported Commands](offensive/network/enumeration/irc_enumeration/gathering_server_information/server_rules_and_supported_commands/): Includes server guidelines displayed upon connection, providing insights into operational governance and possibly hinting at privileged command structures.

IRC bots can be leveraged for automated enumeration by sending specific requests or leveraging their permissions to gather hidden or privileged information.

Exploiting weaknesses in IRC server information leakage involves identifying unintentional disclosures through errors or overly verbose configurations. By understanding these exposures, attackers can leverage them as a pivot for further exploits.

- [Exploring Operator Privileges and Modes](offensive/network/enumeration/irc_enumeration/gathering_server_information/exploring_operator_privileges_and_modes/): Enumerate higher-privilege users and the modes they operate under, potentially revealing avenues to escalate privileges or undermine existing controls. This involves analyzing extended user modes and permissions that allow certain actions in IRC environments.

Cross-analyzing enumerated data with known vulnerability databases can help plan subsequent exploitation phases or offer insights into defensive measures applicable to mitigate potential attacks.

Through structured and methodical enumeration of IRC environments, attackers equip themselves with comprehensive knowledge to better comprehend and exploit IRC networks.
