# Identifying Schema Structures

### Schema Listing Techniques

**System Catalog Exploration**

System catalog exploration involves analyzing the `pg_catalog` schema, which is a part of any PostgreSQL database, to extract detailed schema information. `%pg_catalog` contains system tables and views that store metadata about the database, its schemas, configurations, and permissions. To enumerate schemas, you can query tables such as `pg_namespace` which holds information about each schema in the database. A typical query to list all schemas would be:

```sql
SELECT nspname FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace;
```

By running such queries, you can identify available schemas and gain insights into their structure without requiring additional permissions.

**Database Metadata Extraction**

Database metadata extraction focuses on using the `information_schema.schemata` view as a reliable source for gathering schema information. This view conforms to the SQL standard and provides a structured way of accessing schema metadata. You can retrieve details such as schema names, schema owners, and default character sets. The following query can be used to list all schemas and their relevant metadata:

```sql
SELECT schema_name 
FROM information_schema.schemata;
```

This method is especially effective in environments with strict privilege settings due to its reliance on standard and often accessible views.

### Schema Analysis Tactics

**Schema Object Identification**

Once schemas are enumerated, the next step is identifying specific objects within these schemas, such as tables, views, sequences, and functions. Understanding the relationships between these objects is crucial. Queries against the `information_schema.tables` and `pg_catalog.pg_class` can provide insight into table structures and row characteristics, while `information_schema.columns` offers detailed column data. Hereâ€™s how you can list tables within a specific schema:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'target_schema';
```

**Role Privilege Verification**

Schema structures often include role-based access privileges that can reveal weaknesses or potential for exploitation. Examining tables like `pg_roles` and `pg_auth_members` helps verify user roles and their rights. For example, to check the privileges of a role over a particular schema, you can use:

```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type 
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants 
WHERE table_schema = 'target_schema';
```

Such queries can help pinpoint roles with elevated privileges that may be targeted for further privilege escalation attempts.

### Automated Schema Enumeration Tools

**Tool Utilization**

Automated schema enumeration tools, such as SQLmap or Metasploit's PostgreSQL modules, can significantly streamline the process of identifying schema structures. These tools can interact with a PostgreSQL database to run pre-defined or custom SQL injection attacks to discover schema information rapidly. For SQLmap, the syntax could be:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://targeturl.com/page" --dbms=postgresql --dump-schema
```

This command outlines how you can effectively use SQLmap to enumerate schema structures without manual query crafting.

**Output Interpretation**

Interpretation of the outputs from these automated tools is crucial for constructing an accurate picture of the database environment. The data obtained needs to be analyzed to map out database relationships and identify potential attack vectors. Reviewing the data for anomalies or unexpected object structures can lead to new insights and opportunities for further exploitation.

### Advanced Query Formulation

**Recursive Query Construction**

With recursive query construction, sophisticated queries can be developed to uncover nested and inherited schema structures. Using Common Table Expressions (CTE), you can build recursive queries that traverse complex relationships between database objects. An example could be:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE schema_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT 
        nspname AS schema_name,
        oid
    FROM 
        pg_namespace
    WHERE 
        nspname = 'public'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        c.nspname,
        c.oid
    FROM 
        pg_namespace c
    INNER JOIN 
        schema_hierarchy sh ON c.oid = sh.oid
)
SELECT * FROM schema_hierarchy;
```

This example demonstrates how recursive queries can iterate through schema objects to provide a detailed structural overview.

**Block Enumeration Techniques**

Block enumeration techniques are designed to bypass traditional defensive measures using SQL blocks and procedural language functionality, such as PL/pgSQL. Advanced enumeration can be performed by crafting blocks that execute multiple queries and return comprehensive schema insights, often evading detection:

```sql
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    FOR record IN 
        SELECT table_name 
        FROM information_schema.tables 
        WHERE table_schema = 'target_schema'
    LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE 'Table: %', record.table_name;
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

The above PL/pgSQL block provides a means to iterate over tables within a specified schema, offering insights beyond linear query execution.

### Building Schema Maps

**Visual Mapping of Schema Structures**

The visual representation of schema structures in the form of diagrams aids in understanding complex database environments. Tools like SchemaSpy or pgModeler can automatically generate such visual maps from the database schema, helping prioritize critical areas for further investigation and potential exploitation.

**Layering Discovered Schema Elements**

Layering discovered schema elements means organizing the identified components into a hierarchically structured map. This approach allows for prioritizing targets, understanding schema dependencies, and identifying potential choke points where access can be leveraged or expanded. By correlating these layers with known vulnerabilities, one can effectively plan offensive operations tailored to the discovered database environment.
