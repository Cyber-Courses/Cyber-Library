### Enumerating Tables and Views

Understanding how to enumerate tables and views within a PostgreSQL database is a critical step in offensive cybersecurity operations, especially during the enumeration phase. This knowledge allows attackers to map the database schema, identify sensitive data, and potentially exploit inadequately configured permissions. Here, we delve into various strategies and tools used to efficiently gather this information in a PostgreSQL environment.

#### Understanding PostgreSQL System Catalogs

PostgreSQL stores a wealth of metadata about database objects in system catalogs, making them essential repositories for discovering tables and views. These catalog tables contain information about database objects, user permissions, and more. 

- **System Catalog Basics**: PostgreSQL's system catalogs are akin to a metadata dictionary. Key catalogs include `pg_class`, which stores information about tables and most other types of objects; `pg_attribute`, which contains data about table columns; and `pg_catalog`, a schema that includes these and other system tables.
  
- **Role and Importance**: Understanding these catalogs is paramount for enumerating tables and views. They provide a read-only view of your database's structure, which attackers can exploit to identify targets and plan subsequent actions.

#### Privilege Escalation via Table Enumeration

Enumerating tables isn't just about knowing what's thereâ€”it's about understanding permissions and access rights. Databases often have tables that inadvertently grant excessive permissions to users.

- **Identifying Misconfigured Permissions**: Attackers look for tables with overly permissive access settings, such as tables that grant read or write access to public or less-secure roles.

- **Exploitation Techniques**: Once identified, these tables can be exploited to escalate privileges, inject malicious data, or exfiltrate sensitive information.

#### Enumerating Tables

The primary catalogs for table enumeration in PostgreSQL are `information_schema.tables` and `pg_catalog.pg_tables`.

- **Using `information_schema.tables`**: This schema provides a comprehensive list of all non-system tables. A simple query like `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';` will list all user-defined tables in the public schema.

- **Advanced Insights with `pg_catalog.pg_tables`**: This catalog can be used similarly to gain more specific or additional details about tables. For instance, querying `SELECT tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';` will also yield a list of tables, potentially with different access to additional metadata not covered by `information_schema`.

#### Enumerating Views

Views, being stored queries, can also be enumerated using specific catalogs.

- **`information_schema.views` for Basic Enumeration**: Similar to tables, views can be listed with a command such as `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.views WHERE table_schema = 'public';`.

- **In-depth Enumeration via `pg_catalog.pg_views`**: This allows attackers to gain further insight into the structure of views, which might reveal underlying queries or additional metadata useful for crafting attacks.

#### SQL Injection for Table and View Discovery

SQL Injection remains a potent method to force a database to reveal its schema.

- **Payload Crafting**: Attackers construct SQL injection payloads that query the `information_schema` to extract table names. For instance, a payload like `' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables --` could be used to retrieve table names, assuming injection vulnerabilities are present.

- **Data Stealth Techniques**: By extracting small amounts of information per request and using indirect query patterns, attackers can reduce the risk of detection when conducting enumeration through SQL injection.

#### Automated Tools and Scripts for Enumeration

Automation tools play a significant role in rapidly discovering database objects.

- **Nmap for PostgreSQL Enumeration**: Scripts within Nmap can be configured to probe PostgreSQL databases and enumerate tables and views automatically.

- **Leveraging SQLMap**: SQLMap is a powerful tool that automates the detection and exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities and can be used to enumerate database schema elements like tables and views using specific options.

#### Analyzing Results

Post-enumeration, attackers prioritize targets based on sensitivity and accessibility.

- **Data Categorization**: Tables and views are assessed based on their content and relation to critical business functions. Data sensitivity determines subsequent attack vectors.

- **Prioritization for Further Action**: Results are ranked by potential impact or ease of exploitation, guiding later stages of the penetration test or attack.

#### Defense Evasion Techniques

To evade detection during enumeration activities, attackers employ various strategies.

- **Concealing Activity**: Techniques like query timing randomization, use of encrypted communications, and session spoofing can help disguise enumeration activities.

- **Minimizing Footprints**: Limiting the number of queries and interspersing legitimate access can help attackers remain under the radar as they enumerate database schema elements.

#### Link to Foundational Knowledge: Technology/PostgreSQL

A thorough understanding of PostgreSQL's architecture and security model is crucial for effective enumeration. Offensive practitioners should be well-versed in the database's structure, including its system catalogs and privilege management system, to accurately identify and exploit potential weaknesses.
