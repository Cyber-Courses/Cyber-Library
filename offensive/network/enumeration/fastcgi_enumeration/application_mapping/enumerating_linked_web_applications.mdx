# Enumerating Linked Web Applications

## Leveraging Web Crawlers for Application Discovery

Web crawlers are automated tools designed to traverse web applications systematically. By configuring advanced web crawlers, such as Burp Suite's Spider or OWASP ZAP, security professionals can discover linked web applications through the analysis of URLs, links, and resources embedded within a target site. Configuration may include setting the depth of crawl and ensuring adherence to the robots.txt file unless specifically targeting hidden resources.

Sitemaps and robots.txt files can provide valuable insight into a site’s architecture and potential linked applications. These files often reveal URLs of linked applications that might not be directly visible through the site’s navigation. Automated tools can parse these files to identify additional scanning targets and information about the site's public and private segments.

The data obtained from crawlers can be analyzed to identify external links, hidden application entry points, and interconnected web application components. By further examining URL patterns, query parameters, and response codes, testers can establish a comprehensive understanding of the web environment and its linked applications.

## Utilizing OSINT for Linked Application Enumeration

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques allow security professionals to gather information about linked web applications from publicly accessible sources. WHOIS and DNS enumeration are foundational techniques in this category that can identify domains and subdomains potentially related to the target web application. Tools like `whois`, `nslookup`, and `dnsenum` provide powerful ways to map digital assets by revealing registration and network information.

Web caches and archives, like the Wayback Machine, can be goldmines of historical site data, showing previously linked applications and older architectures that might still be relevant or re-implemented. By scraping and analyzing such data, professionals can unveil the evolution and expansion of a web application's link system.

Social media platforms and open code repositories such as GitHub are additional venues where information about linked applications might be inadvertently exposed. Security testers can use scripts and specialized search syntax to query these platforms for references to linked applications, internal links, or relevant development discussions.

## Extracting Linked Applications via API Interaction

Linked applications often communicate through APIs, providing a pathway for enumeration. Identifying and exploiting improperly secured APIs can expose connections between web applications. Tools like Postman or Insomnia can be used to enumerate API endpoints, parameters, and authentication mechanisms to discover networks of service dependencies.

Microservices architecture, common in modern web deployments, presents another avenue for discovering linked applications. Each service might represent a different application, and by mapping out API interactions, testers can understand interdependencies and locate additional applications.

OAuth and token-based authentication mechanisms are frequently used by APIs to authorize access. By analyzing these flows, testers can identify tokens that grant privileges across multiple linked applications, potentially revealing more targets for enumeration.

## Analysis of JavaScript Files for Application References

JavaScript files can contain hardcoded links, endpoints, and references to additional web applications. By decompiling and analyzing these files, testers can reveal applications that might be linked to the main site. Tools such as `unminify` and `JSBeautifier` assist in making JavaScript code more readable, facilitating the enumeration of hardcoded URLs.

Dynamic script loading is a technique often used by developers to modularize and optimize web applications. During analysis, testers may identify external scripts that are loaded dynamically and point to linked applications.

JavaScript obfuscation can hide these references. However, by reversing this obfuscation through specialized tools and techniques, security professionals may uncover hidden application links and endpoints embedded within the obfuscated code.

## Reverse Engineering Web Proxy Traffic

Web proxies are powerful tools for capturing and analyzing HTTP(S) traffic between clients and servers. By using tools like Burp Suite or Fiddler, security professionals can inspect the traffic to find requests to linked applications. Analyzing this traffic can expose URLs, parameters, tokens, and headers that reveal application linkages.

Decryption of HTTPS traffic may be required to view content not observable over the wire. Proxy tools with man-in-the-middle (MITM) capabilities can decrypt this traffic, allowing a comprehensive view of all interactions.

Session identifiers and authentication tokens captured in traffic logs can help to construct a map of application interactions. By correlating these tokens with specific applications, testers can track how sessions and user data flow between linked applications.

## Identifying Application Links through Content Management Systems (CMS)

Content Management Systems often serve as hubs from which linked applications are managed. By identifying the CMS in use, testers can uncover typical link pathways to additional applications or services managed through the same platform. Tools for CMS identification, such as Wappalyzer or CMSmap, can expedite this process.

Plugins and features specific to a CMS may expose linked applications through vulnerable endpoints or misconfigurations. Shared resources or components like internal linking tools and widgets might inadvertently disclose linked applications.

Moreover, shared or misconfigured content delivery networks (CDNs) associated with a CMS can sometimes expose pathways to additional applications. By analyzing and exploiting these vulnerabilities, testers can draw connections between different applications offered on the network.

## Networking Protocol Analysis for Application Linkage

Network protocol analysis allows testers to capture traffic at the network level to identify linkage patterns between applications. Tools like Wireshark can capture and filter traffic to isolate communications that indicate dependencies or links between applications. Protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS should be examined for headers and payloads suggesting application service links.

Protocol-specific techniques like examining UDP/TCP transactions can further illuminate service patterns that signal application linkages. This bottom-up approach provides additional insights into how applications are linked beyond what is visible at the application layer.

Mapping the full architecture includes correlating network traces with previously identified domains and endpoints. By understanding how systems are interconnected at the network layer, testers can draw a complete map of all linked applications and identify potential vulnerabilities across the ecosystem.
