### Identifying FTP Services and Ports

**Port Scanning Techniques**  
Port scanning is an essential step in identifying active FTP services. While traditional uses of TCP SYN scan and TCP Connect scan suffice for most standard environments, it's crucial to understand the nuances of scanning both standard (port 21 for FTP, port 990 for FTPS) and non-standard ports. The TCP SYN scan, also known as half-open scanning, allows a stealthier approach by only sending the initial SYN packet to probe for a response from the server. This technique reduces the traceability of the scan as no full TCP connection is established. In contrast, a TCP Connect scan creates a full TCP handshake, ensuring more reliable port status but at the cost of increased detection risk by security devices. Command syntax in Nmap for basic TCP SYN scan looks like:

```bash
nmap -sS -p 21,990 <target-ip>
```

For TCP Connect scans, the syntax is:

```bash
nmap -sT -p 21,990 <target-ip>
```

Additionally, implement UDP scans in scenarios where non-conventional ports might be in use or when anomalies in protocol handling are suspected.

**Service Detection with Nmap**  
Nmap's ability to detect services extends beyond identifying open ports to actually analyzing the service running behind those ports. This is particularly critical for FTP services, where version and implementation details can directly map to known vulnerabilities. Using Nmap’s service scanning capabilities allows attackers to verify the services and sometimes uncover hidden ones. By adding the `-sV` flag, Nmap attempts to determine the version of the service that’s running. Example usage:

```bash
nmap -sV -p 21,990 <target-ip>
```

This command attempts to probe known FTP ports and identify associated services, facilitating subsequent vulnerability assessments.

**OS Fingerprinting Correlation**  
Correlating OS fingerprinting with FTP port and service scans can provide contextually richer insights. If the operating system of the target host can be identified, attackers can specifically tailor their approaches to consider OS-specific vulnerabilities or protection mechanisms. Nmap’s OS detection feature, invoked with the `-O` flag, complements service detection by providing information about the system architecture that can influence attack strategies:

```bash
nmap -O <target-ip>
```

Such synergy enhances the overall reconnaissance phase, effectively bridging the gap between abstract port states and practical exploitability.

### Fingerprinting FTP Versions and Implementations

**Banner Grabbing Techniques**  
Banner grabbing remains a classic method to ascertain the running version of an FTP service. By establishing a raw connection using tools like Telnet or Netcat, attackers can initiate a manual FTP session to elicit responses from the server. These banners often contain useful version and software information. A typical banner grabbing might involve:

```bash
nc -v <target-ip> 21
```

This command opens a TCP connection to the FTP port, expecting the service to respond with an initial handshaking message, commonly revealing server information. Specialized FTP commands can further exploit the server’s verbosity to uncover additional details if the initial banner is ambiguous.

**Automating Version Detection**  
Automation of version detection significantly expedites this phase in large-scale operations. Nmap, with its robust scripting engine, can be configured to run targeted scripts that automatically extract version information. For example, by deploying the `ftp-vsftpd-backdoor` NSE script, you can swiftly identify backdoor vulnerabilities:

```bash
nmap --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor <target-ip>
```

These automated techniques ensure comprehensive coverage across numerous targets, rapidly collecting intelligence that would be cumbersome manually.

**Correlation with Exploit Databases**  
Post identification, it’s strategic to cross-reference gathered version data with various exploit databases like the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database or Exploit DB. This correlation illuminates potential vulnerability pathways, enabling crafted exploit development. Detailed reconnaissance can precisely align version data with historical vulnerabilities, setting the stage for actionable exploits.

**Custom Scripting for Version Evasion**  
Sophisticated FTP servers may employ version masking to thwart identification attempts. In such cases, creating custom scripts tailored to overcome these defenses is beneficial. These scripts leverage patterns and anomalies in server responses to deduce hidden information, offering attackers a defensive edge. Techniques might include deploying custom malformed FTP requests or timing-based investigation to derive additional data points that standard tools might overlook.

By mastering these techniques, offensive operatives can ensure a nuanced, multi-layered approach to FTP service and version detection, crucial for mounting successful infiltration campaigns. This comprehensive understanding not only aids direct exploitation efforts but also improves overall intelligence gathering capabilities in cyber operations.
