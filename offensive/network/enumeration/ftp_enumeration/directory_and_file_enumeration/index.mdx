# Directory and File Enumeration

The process of directory and file enumeration within an FTP environment involves systematically identifying directories and files that can be accessed and potentially manipulated. This aspect of offensive cybersecurity focuses on leveraging FTP protocol weaknesses or configurations to gain insights or control over underlying systems.

## Listing Accessible Directories

Enumerating accessible directories begins with the use of straightforward FTP commands such as `ls` or `dir`, which function similarly to their UNIX and DOS counterparts, respectively. These commands allow an attacker to list the directories on an FTP server that their session has permissions to access. With these commands, one can obtain a basic structure of the directory hierarchy, which provides clues about the server's organization and potential areas to probe further.

To enhance directory enumeration, automated tools like `Nmap` with the `ftp-anon` script can be utilized to identify accessible directories in a more efficient manner. `Nmap` scripts can be configured for specific tasks such as finding common directory structures or checking for anonymous access. Similarly, tools such as `Nikto` can be employed to perform broader scans that may provide directory listings as part of vulnerability assessments.

For more rigorous directory discovery, wordlist-based brute-forcing techniques can be employed with tools like `DirBuster` or `Gobuster`. These tools attempt to navigate through guessed directory names using pre-built wordlists, uncovering hidden directories that might not be listed directly due to server-side restrictions or file permissions.

Breaking through access restrictions is a critical skill when performing directory enumeration. By understanding specific FTP server configurations, one can identify potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass directory listing restrictions. For instance, exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities may allow listing of directories beyond the current root by manipulating directory traversal characters (e.g., `../`).

## Enumerating Readable and Writable Files

Identifying readable and writable files on an FTP server involves digging into file permissions and understanding the implication of each fileâ€™s access rights. Start by using basic FTP commands to attempt reading files with obvious extensions, such as `.txt`, `.ini`, `.conf`, etc., which may contain configuration details or sensitive information like credentials. 

The importance of listing readable files cannot be overstated, as readable files may contain logs, configurations, or even user data that can serve as a foothold into deeper system access. When enumerating readable files, consider the use of recursive directory listing options to ensure all nested files are inspected.

Writable files and directories represent a significant vector for escalating privileges or deploying additional attacks. Identifying writable directories using commands like `site` (if supported by the server) can highlight locations where files can be uploaded. Once identified, writable directories can be used to deploy web shells or bypass access controls through file manipulation.

Advanced enumeration of write capabilities involves scripting tools in languages like Python to automate the check for writable permissions across the entire directory structure. Scripts can attempt to upload a test file to verify write access and monitor for changes in permissions over time. 

Maintaining access through writable paths often involves techniques such as uploading scripts or binaries that provide a persistent backdoor into the system. Once a test payload is confirmed to execute, further payloads can be uploaded to extend attacks, such as privilege escalation or network reconnaissance tools.

In conclusion, directory and file enumeration on FTP servers plays a critical role in uncovering vulnerabilities that can be exploited for deeper system penetration. By employing comprehensive enumeration strategies, attackers can gain detailed insights into the server's structure, thereby aiding in devising further attack tactics.
