# FTP Enumeration

## Service and Version Detection

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) enumeration is essential for identifying and exploiting potential vulnerabilities in networked systems. This process involves recognizing and analyzing the specific type of FTP service running on the network and identifying any weaknesses that may be present.

### Introduction to FTP Service Enumeration
FTP operates over TCP ports (typically port 21 for control commands) and is commonly used to transfer files between computers. Enumerating FTP services involves scanning the network to identify systems with FTP active. Detecting FTP services often requires determining the presence of open ports associated with FTP operation, which can be achieved using port scanning tools.

### Using Nmap for FTP Version Detection
Nmap is a widely-used network scanner that can detect running services and their versions through its scripting engine. To detect an FTP service and version with Nmap, use the following command:

```shell
nmap -sV -p 21 <target-ip-address>
```

This command instructs Nmap to perform version detection on port 21 of the target IP address. The `-sV` flag tells Nmap to determine service versions, providing information on the FTP server software and its version, which could highlight version-specific vulnerabilities.

Nmap's script engine can further augment this discovery by using scripts that specifically target FTP services, such as `ftp-anon`, `ftp-brute`, and `ftp-syst`. Running Nmap with these scripts helps enumerate additional details:

```shell
nmap --script=ftp-anon,ftp-syst -p 21 <target-ip-address>
```

### Employing Banner Grabbing
Banner grabbing is an essential technique for identifying service versions and validating the presence of particular vulnerabilities in an FTP service. Using netcat or telnet, a direct connection can be made to the FTP server to retrieve its banner:

```shell
nc <target-ip-address> 21
```

The retrieved banner typically includes software version information that can be cross-referenced with vulnerability databases to check for known exploits or security issues related to that software and version.

## Directory and File Enumeration

Detecting and interpreting file structures on an FTP server enables security professionals to identify critical files and directories that may contain sensitive information or configuration details.

### Accessing and Mapping FTP Directory Structures
Once logged into an FTP server, directory enumeration helps in listing and accessing available files and directories:

```shell
ftp <target-ip-address>
> ls
```

This command lists files and directories present within the current FTP directory. Itâ€™s important to identify files, directories, and subdirectories that can be examined or manipulated to leverage further exploitation opportunities.

### Advanced Directory Listing Techniques
Recursive directory listing techniques involve the use of automated tools or scripts to traverse deep into the FTP file structure, revealing nested directories:

```shell
wget --mirror --no-parent ftp://<username>:<password>@<target-ip-address>/directory/
```

Using wget with the `--mirror` and `--no-parent` options can recursively download both files and directories, creating a local mirror of the directory structure for offline examination.

### Identifying Hidden Files and Directories
Hidden files and directories often hold the key to circumventing security controls. FTP clients provide specific commands to unveil such files:

```shell
ls -a
```

Using manual commands like `ls -a` or implementing custom scripts can help identify hidden files that could contain backup configurations, hidden credentials, or deprecated features vulnerable to exploitation.

## Anonymous Access Verification

Anonymous FTP access can be a significant vulnerability, allowing unrestricted file viewing and transfer operations without user authentication.

### Detecting and Exploiting Anonymous FTP Access
Security testers must identify if an FTP server allows anonymous logins. To attempt an anonymous user login, use:

```shell
ftp <target-ip-address>
> USER anonymous
> PASS <your-email-address>
```

If the login is successful, it suggests that the FTP server's misconfiguration could permit unauthorized file access or service abuse.

### Assessing Permissions and Access Controls
Determining the access level granted to anonymous users is critical. Once logged in, testers should list available directories and attempt to download files to see what permissions are in place. Depending on server configuration, some directories might expose write-access, leading to data exfiltration or injection risks.

Using FTP enumeration, professionals can map service structures, identify weaknesses, and develop attack strategies tailored to specific vulnerabilities. This process is instrumental in securing network architectures by highlighting broadly exploitable configurations and preventing unauthorized access via FTP services.
