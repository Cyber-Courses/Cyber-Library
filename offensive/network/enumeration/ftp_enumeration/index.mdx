# FTP Enumeration

## [Service and Version Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/ftp_enumeration/Service%20and%20Version%20Detection)

Direct interrogation of the FTP service is a critical first step in effective FTP enumeration. Initiating this process involves accessing the service via typical banner grabbing techniques. Tools such as `telnet`, `Netcat`, or dedicated network scanners like Nmap can request and retrieve service banners automatically. The banner often contains explicit version details and may include additional clues about the service's configuration.

Banner grabbing might reveal important details about the FTP server's software and version. This information can be cross-referenced with vulnerability databases, such as the CVE list or specialized security research databases, to identify vulnerabilities specific to that version. Exploiting these vulnerabilities often requires tailored approaches, with some vulnerabilities offering direct exploitation while others may require preliminary steps.

Fingerprinting extends beyond the banner. It involves identifying specific implementation details of the FTP service, which can also highlight subtler version distinctions or bespoke configurations. Active fingerprinting uses tools that send specific queries to observe response characteristics, while passive fingerprinting analyzes traffic flows or logs without engaging with the target system directly. Verify these methods' legality in your jurisdiction, as network fingerprinting can be intrusive.

## [Directory and File Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/ftp_enumeration/Directory%20and%20File%20Enumeration)

Once service identification is complete, attention should turn to file and directory structure enumeration. An FTP server's directory hierarchy can reveal much about its operational scope and potentially available data. Start by performing recursive directory listing, which systematically explores directory hierarchy depth and breadth. Tools like `ls` over an authenticated FTP session support this, while scripts in Python or Perl can automate the process.

Searching for sensitive files involves pattern identification. Systems often follow naming conventions where common or sensitive files have predictable names. For example, files associated with backup extensions (.bak, .old) or containing keyword identifiers (admin, config) might be more fruitful targets for discovery efforts. Incorporating file size and date modified filters can refine the search, helping to focus on likely candidates for sensitive data exposure.

Automated tools such as `DirBuster` and `Gobuster` may facilitate directory exploration by shotgun guessing common directory names or employing wordlists to unearth less obvious directory paths. These tools can handle extensive URL permutations allowing thorough brushing of potential directory paths often overlooked in manual checks.

## [Anonymous Access Verification](offensive/network/enumeration/ftp_enumeration/Anonymous%20Access%20Verification)

Verification of anonymous access capabilities involves pivotal checks to ascertain the server's authentication posture. You should probe the server for enabled anonymous logins by attempting to connect with the `anonymous` username and empty or predictable email format password. Some legacy systems may allow unrestricted access here, serving as a significant vector for information leakage or further exploitation.

Such anonymized access levels should be methodically evaluated: determine directory access levels (stricted vs. unrestricted), file access permissions (read/write versus read-only), and operational impacts (content exposure/alteration). Compiling data on these aspects can quantify risk and inform the defense's rectification measures.

Identifying default or weakly protected paths within the server represents another task area. The prevalence of hardcoded credentials or overly permissive settings can expose databases, system files, or other operational data critical to adversarial intelligence. Usage of brute-force scripts like `Hydra` or credential-testing tools like `Medusa` can facilitate the discovery of weak points by systematically attempting connections with commonly known default credentials or variations of weak protection passwords. Always ensure legal compliance and ethical consideration when using these tools and techniques.

By employing a systematic methodology as detailed above, penetration testers and cybersecurity analysts can effectively enumerate and assess FTP services within the broader context of network security enumeration.
