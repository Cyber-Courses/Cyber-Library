## Discovering Default or Weak Credentials

### Understanding Default Credentials in FTP

Default credentials are a common security misconfiguration in many systems, including FTP servers. These are the factory-set usernames and passwords that manufacturers provide, often intended for initial access or management purposes. They are typically well-documented and publicly available, making them an easy target for attackers. When deploying an FTP server, it's crucial to change these credentials promptly. 

#### Recognizing Default Accounts

Default accounts are typically found in user manuals or vendor-specific documents that outline initial setup procedures. Common examples include usernames like `admin`, `root`, `user`, and passwords like `admin`, `password`, or even blank passwords. Understanding and recognizing these defaults in FTP configurations require familiarity with the various FTP server implementations, such as ProFTPD and vsftpd, which may have differing default credentials.

#### Analyzing FTP Server Implementations

Each FTP server implementation may have unique default settings. By studying vendor documentation, you can compile a comprehensive list of default usernames and passwords associated with popular FTP products. This knowledge allows you to quickly identify potentially unsecured accounts, providing a pathway for unauthorized access.

### Techniques for Credential Discovery

The process of discovering default or weak credentials involves employing various technical techniques to access systems using known default information or poorly implemented security configurations, such as weak password policies.

#### Crafting and Executing Credential Attacks

Credential attacks often utilize dictionaries containing popular and default username-password combinations. Two common methods here are:

- **Credential Spraying:** This technique involves trying a small number of commonly used passwords across many accounts, reducing the risk of triggering account lockout mechanisms.
- **Brute Force Attacks:** In contrast, this approach involves systematically trying all possible combinations of a password. While thorough, it is more likely to be detected and countered by security systems.

Each method requires careful planning to avoid detection and account lockout.

#### Leveraging Automated Tools

Tools like **Hydra**, **Medusa**, and Metasploit's auxiliary modules can automate the process of password guessing. These tools allow operators to configure attacks, select dictionaries, and specify parameters to efficiently execute credential brute forcing. For example:

```shell
hydra -l admin -P /path/to/password/list.txt ftp://192.168.1.100
```

In this command, `Hydra` is instructed to attempt connections to the FTP server at `192.168.1.100` using the username `admin` and a password list.

### Weak Password Identification

Identifying weak passwords involves understanding common patterns and user tendencies, exploiting the frequent use of simple, predictable passwords that many users default to creating.

#### Building Weak Password Models

Pattern analysis can reveal commonalities in weak passwords, such as the use of sequential numbers, dictionary words, and simple substitutions (e.g., `Passw0rd`). Additionally, insights from social engineering can inform likely choices based on user behavior.

#### MITM for Credential Capture

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks can intercept credentials transmitted over unencrypted FTP sessions. Operators may use tools like Wireshark or Ettercap to capture this traffic:

```shell
ettercap -T -M arp:remote -i eth0 //192.168.1.100// //
```

This example demonstrates how an MITM attack can be used to view sensitive FTP user information, although decrypting credentials may require further steps, depending on encryption levels employed by the server.

### Defensive Countermeasures

Understanding potential defensive measures and adversarial tactics can prevent operators from falling into traps set by security teams.

#### Identifying and Avoiding Honeypots

Honeypots are decoys set up to detect and analyze attacker behavior. Warning signs include traps on common ports and unusual system responses. Skilled operators will recognize these discrepancies and proceed with caution or abort operations.

#### Handling Account Lockouts

Balancing aggression and stealth while conducting credential attacks is crucial to avoid triggering account lockouts. This involves pacing attempts and using smart logic to mimic normal user behavior, keeping operations below detection thresholds.

In summary, discovering default or weak credentials on FTP servers calls for strategic information gathering combined with the application of both manual techniques and automated tools. Understanding defensive strategies and maintaining ethical operational conduct is crucial for achieving effective and responsible offensive security practices.
