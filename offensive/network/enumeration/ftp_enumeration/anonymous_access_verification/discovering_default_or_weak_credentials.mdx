## Understanding Default Credentials

Default credentials in FTP services often include basic username and password combinations provided by vendors. These credentials are intended for initial setup and troubleshooting but are frequently left unchanged, creating a significant security vulnerability. Common default usernames include `admin`, `user`, `root`, and passwords such as `password`, `1234`, or `admin`. External resources like vendor documentation, internet forums, and databases such as CIRT.net's Default Password List provide comprehensive lists of these credentials.

To discover default credentials, knowledge of the target's specific hardware or software configuration is crucial. Identifying the make and model of the hosted FTP service can lead to targeted efforts using standard default username-password pairs. This is often an initial step in penetration testing or red team assessments, highlighting the security oversights many organizations make by not changing or disabling the defaults.

## Using Automated Tools for Credential Discovery

Tools like Hydra, Medusa, and Ncrack are invaluable for automating the process of brute-forcing FTP credentials. Hydra, for example, is a versatile login cracker that supports numerous protocols, including FTP. It enables attackers to automate the process of trying multiple username-password pairs in a fraction of the time it would take manually.

An example Hydra command targeting an FTP server might look like this:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /path/to/wordlist.txt ftp://192.168.1.100
```

This command directs Hydra to use the username `admin` and a wordlist located at `/path/to/wordlist.txt` against the FTP service at `192.168.1.100`. Medusa and Ncrack offer similar functionalities, with the ability to adjust attack parameters to optimize performance and avoid detection.

## Customizing Wordlists

While default credentials are a starting point, customized wordlists can significantly increase the chance of success in credential attacks on FTP servers. Tools like CeWL and Crunch facilitate the creation of wordlists tailored to specific targets by harvesting words from websites or generating sequences with specific parameters.

For instance, using CeWL, one could generate a wordlist from a target's website:

```bash
cewl http://targetwebsite.com -w wordlist.txt
```

Crunch can be used to generate a wordlist with a defined character set and length:

```bash
crunch 6 8 abcdef123456 -o wordlist.txt
```

These wordlists can then be employed in brute-force attacks, leveraging public information and specifics pertaining to the target environment.

## Bypassing Account Lockouts

When attempting to brute force credentials, encountering account lockout mechanisms is possible. Sophisticated strategies are necessary to mitigate this risk. Attackers can use methods such as distributing attempts across time (time-based attacks) or taking advantage of services with delayed lockout thresholds.

For instance, staggering login attempts to mimic legitimate users can help an adversary remain undetected. Understanding the lockout policies of the target system is beneficial — some lockouts reset after a predetermined amount of time or rely on a threshold of failed attempts within a specific period.

## Credential Harvesting through Network Capture

FTP traffic is often not encrypted, making it possible for attackers to intercept login credentials transmitted over the network. Tools like Wireshark or TCPdump can capture this traffic, provided the attacker has a position in the network that allows for packet sniffing.

Capturing FTP traffic can be as simple as executing:

```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 port 21 -w ftp_traffic.pcap
```

This command captures all traffic on the default FTP port (21) for interface `eth0` and writes it to a file named `ftp_traffic.pcap`. Once captured, analyzing the packets with Wireshark allows attackers to extract credentials transmitted in plaintext.

## Exploiting Weak Password Policies

FTP services with insufficient password policies present exploitable vulnerabilities. Enumerating these weaknesses involves examining the response behavior to login attempts and noting policies like password length, complexity requirements, and rotation intervals.

Using gathered reconnaissance, attackers can devise effective strategies to exploit these policies. For instance, if an organization allows simple passwords or rarely enforces changes, a brute-force attack using common passwords from past breach data sets becomes more effective. Understanding password recovery mechanisms can also be key — if an attacker can trigger and exploit a password reset, they may gain unauthorized access without extensive brute-force efforts.
