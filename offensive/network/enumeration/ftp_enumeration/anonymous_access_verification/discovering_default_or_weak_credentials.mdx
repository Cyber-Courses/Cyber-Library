## Discovering Default or Weak Credentials

### Overview

In the realm of offensive network security, discovering default or weak credentials forms a crucial part of assessing the security posture of FTP (File Transfer Protocol) services. Penetration testers focus on identifying these vulnerabilities as they often serve as key points of entry into a system. This practice involves systematically probing for known default username-password combinations and testing for commonly used weak passwords. Such credentials might exist due to neglect in updating default settings or poor password policies, presenting an opportunity for unauthorized access.

### Steps for Identifying Default or Weak Credentials

- **Understanding Default Credentials**

Default credentials are pre-configured username-password combinations provided by manufacturers or developers to facilitate initial access to systems or applications. These credentials are widely known and can often be found in online databases or manufacturer documentation. Penetration testers should compile a comprehensive list of default FTP credentials specific to the target environment. Tools and resources like the SecLists GitHub repository can provide extensive databases of these credentials. Understanding the context and configuration of the target FTP system is essential for selecting the correct default credential list.

- **Testing for Weak Credentials**

Weak credentials commonly arise from user-generated passwords that are either simple, easily guessable, or found in standard password dictionaries. Creating an effective password dictionary involves combining commonly used passwords with variations related to the target, such as company names or abbreviations. Utilizing tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper can automate the process of password dictionary attacks, systematically attempting multiple combinations to break weak passwords. These tools can be further customized with rules to intelligently guess passwords based on observed patterns or constraints.

### Tools for Credential Discovery

- **Automated Scanning Tools**

Automated tools such as Hydra, Medusa, and Ncrack are invaluable for performing credential discovery through brute force attacks. These tools facilitate high-speed attempts against services with minimal manual configuration. For example, using Hydra to perform an FTP password attack might look like the following command:

  ```bash
  hydra -l username -P /path/to/passwordlist.txt ftp://target_ip
  ```

This command specifies a single username (`-l username`) and a file path to a password list (`-P /path/to/passwordlist.txt`) while targeting an FTP service at the specified IP address.

- **Credential Spraying Techniques**

Credential spraying involves attempting a few commonly used passwords against many accounts over time. This approach reduces the risk of lockouts or detection due to repeated attempts against a single account. Tools like CrackMapExec or custom scripts can facilitate credential spraying. It's essential to incorporate timing delays and rotate IPs when performing credential spraying to avoid detection by intrusion detection systems (IDS).

### Mitigation of Default or Weak Credentials

Mitigating the risks associated with default or weak credentials involves a combination of policy and technical measures. Regular audits of system configurations should be conducted to identify and remediate any default credentials. Security policies should enforce the use of strong password creation practices, ensuring complexity and regular updating. User education and awareness programs can further bolster efforts to reduce the prevalence of weak credentials.

### Integration with Enumeration Strategies

Credential discovery does not stand alone; it should be integrated into a broader enumeration strategy. By correlating credential findings with system and network enumeration data, testers can identify additional attack vectors. Successfully discovered credentials can be leveraged to escalate privileges, access sensitive data, or deepen network reconnaissance efforts. Incorporating credential discovery within the context of ongoing enumeration maximizes the value of information obtained.

### Ethical and Legal Considerations

Engaging in credential discovery requires strict adherence to ethical standards and legal boundaries. Offensive cybersecurity practitioners must ensure they have explicit authorization and scope specified in engagement contracts. Attacks must be conducted within the defined legal framework to avoid unintended consequences or legal ramifications.

### Advanced Offensive Techniques

- **Customized Targeted Attacks**

For advanced scenarios, penetration testers may develop specifically tailored attacks that incorporate gathered intelligence from preliminary credential discovery efforts. This includes crafting custom tools or scripts to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the attack. Incorporating insights from social engineering tactics can further increase the chance of successfully uncovering credentials.

- **Exploiting Discovered Credentials**

Once credentials are discovered, they can be used to access FTP services illegally and perform further security assessments. Using the compromised access, testers can escalate privileges, navigate the network, and identify additional weaknesses. All actions taken should be meticulously documented, ensuring transparency and accountability in the engagement. Findings should be reported in a structured manner, aligning with the objectives and expected outcomes of the penetration testing engagement.
