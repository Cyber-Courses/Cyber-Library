## Checking for Enabled Anonymous Login

### Conducting Initial Network Scans

The process begins with identifying potential targets that have FTP services running. This involves conducting a network scan to discover open FTP ports, typically port 21. Using Nmap, a widely-used network scanning tool, you can efficiently identify these open services:

```bash
nmap -p 21 --open -sV <target_ip>
```

The above command scans the target IP for open port 21 specifically, using the `-sV` option to attempt to identify the service version running on the port. This initial scanning phase is crucial for mapping the network landscape and identifying systems that may allow anonymous FTP access. 

### Analyzing Network Services

Once the open FTP ports have been identified, it's essential to analyze the services running on those ports to gather more detailed information. This can include the FTP server version, which can give clues about potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Using Nmap's scripting engine, you can perform a deeper analysis:

```bash
nmap -p 21 --script=ftp-anon <target_ip>
```

The `ftp-anon` script within Nmap will specifically check if anonymous login is enabled, providing immediate feedback on this security posture.

### Attempting Anonymous Login

To check for anonymous FTP access, attempt a login using the typical anonymous credentials. This involves connecting to the FTP server using a username of `anonymous` and either a blank password or a common email address as the password. Here is how this can be executed using the FTP command-line client:

```bash
ftp <target_ip>
Name: anonymous
Password: <your_email_address>
```

Successful login using these credentials indicates that anonymous FTP access is enabled. The ability to log in without a specific user account signifies potential security risks, as this access might expose sensitive information stored on the server.

### Enumerating FTP Directory Structure

After logging in, the next step is to explore the directory structure accessible to the anonymous user. This involves navigating through directories to understand the layout, permissions, and potential data exposure:

```bash
ftp> pwd
ftp> cd <directory_path>
ftp> ls
```

These commands allow you to view the present working directory, change directories, and list contents, respectively. Pay attention to directories like `/pub` or `/upload`, which are commonly available for anonymous users.

### Listing Files and Directories

It is important to compile a detailed list of files and directories available through the anonymous account, which can provide insights into what data is potentially at risk:

```bash
ftp> ls -l
```

The `-l` option gives a detailed listing, including file permissions, which helps identify if certain files are readable or writable by the anonymous user.

### Downloading Sensitive Files 

If readable files are identified, the next step is to download them for further analysis. This could involve checking for sensitive information that could be exposed to unauthorized users:

```bash
ftp> get <filename>
```

Use the `get` command to download specific files. If multiple files need to be downloaded, the `mget` command allows for batch downloading.

### Automating Anonymous Login Checks

For auditing multiple systems, it is efficient to automate the checking process. Tools like Medusa or Hydra can be employed to perform these checks across a range of IP addresses, speeding up the process and ensuring thoroughness:

```bash
hydra -l anonymous -p <your_email_address> ftp://<target_ip>
```

These tools will attempt logins and provide reports on systems with enabled anonymous access, allowing for quick identification of at-risk systems.

### Creating Custom FTP Scripts

For a more tailored approach, developing custom scripts using Python can automate the checking and logging processes for anonymous login attempts. Python's `ftplib` library provides a simple interface to write such scripts:

```python
from ftplib import FTP

ftp = FTP('<target_ip>')
ftp.login('anonymous', '<your_email_address>')
files = ftp.nlst()
ftp.quit()
```

Such scripts can be executed across multiple targets and can log detailed results for auditing purposes.

### Analyzing Logs and Outputs

Review the logs and outputs from the various tools and scripts used. This analysis can help identify not just where anonymous access is enabled but also what type of information is potentially exposed. 

### Remediation Verification

After initial identification and remediation efforts, conducting follow-up checks to ensure anonymous FTP access has been properly disabled is crucial. Repeat the initial scanning and login attempts to verify the success of security measures implemented.
