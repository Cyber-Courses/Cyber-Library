# Anonymous Access Verification in FTP Enumeration

## Checking for Enabled Anonymous Login

Anonymous access on FTP servers is a critical point of verification during security assessments as it may expose sensitive data or configuration files inadvertently. The mechanism for anonymous login is often facilitated by allowing users to connect with 'anonymous' as the username and an email-like structure for the password. This section delves into the direct application of techniques to verify anonymous access, indicators of successful access, and strategic considerations to maintain stealth and efficiency.

### Technique Application

To determine if an FTP server allows anonymous login, begin by utilizing command-line FTP clients such as `ftp` or `lftp`. These tools provide a lightweight interface to attempt a connection using 'anonymous' as the username. For example:

```bash
ftp target-ftp-server.com
# Supply 'anonymous' when prompted for the username
# Enter an email address for the password e.g., anon@example.com
```

Upon executing these commands, if the server allows access, it typically indicates an enabled anonymous login, often accompanied by a welcome message or directory listing. For a more automated approach, leverage the Metasploit Framework with:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous
set RHOSTS target-ftp-server.com
run
```

This method helps cover a wide range of targets comparably more efficiently. Capturing FTP banner responses can reveal further configuration details, aiding understanding of the anonymous login settings.

### Indicators of Success

A successful anonymous login attempt will show two primary indicators:
1. **Welcome Message**: Upon login, servers may display a message specifically formatted for anonymous users, sometimes providing usage instructions or expectations.
2. **Access Granted**: Successful access is marked by directory listing or the ability to navigate through non-authenticated sections of the server, which may contain downloadable files.

### Strategic Considerations

When performing anonymous login attempts, analyze network traffic to discern specific server response patterns. This helps in understanding the server's security posture towards anonymous requests. Evading detection involves randomizing login intervals to prevent triggering alert systems or IP blocks, enhancing the stealth of your assessment activities.

## Discovering Default or Weak Credentials

FTP servers may rely, mistakenly, on default or weak credentials, posing significant security risks. Attackers often exploit these states during unauthorized access campaigns.

### Technique Application

To capitalize on the presence of default or weak credentials, brute force tools like `hydra`, `medusa`, or `ncrack` are indispensable. Focus the attack on known defaults from FTP server software documentation, keeping in mind the common username-password combinations like 'admin-admin' or specific usernames like 'ftp' without a password. Execute the following with Hydra:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P password_list.txt target-ftp-server.com ftp
```

This command targets the `admin` username with a list of potential passwords. Incorporate larger and well-curated wordlists to broaden the search for weaknesses effectively.

### Indicators of Success

Successfully leveraging default or weak credentials is evidenced by:
1. **Unauthorized Content Access**: Gaining ability to access otherwise restricted directories signifies a failure in securing access credentials.
2. **Weak Policy Exposure**: Successful brute force attacks reveal lenient password policies, directly affecting the server's security posture.

### Strategic Considerations

When conducting brute force attempts, it's critical to detect account lockout thresholds to avoid triggering defensive mechanisms. Adjust the rate of attempted logins and distribute the workload across different IPs to spread out the attack vector, maintaining a level of covertness. Using distributed attack platforms can effectively circumvent rate limiting, crucial for high-value targets with extensive authentication protection systems.

By examining these two critical avenues of anonymous access verification within FTP enumeration, assessors can uncover significant vulnerabilities and configuration oversights, establishing the foundation for a comprehensive security evaluation.
