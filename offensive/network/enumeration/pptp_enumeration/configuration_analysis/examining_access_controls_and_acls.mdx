# Examining Access Controls and ACLs

## Advanced Understanding of Access Controls

Access control models are frameworks that govern how users and systems interact with resources. The three primary access control models are Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Each model has distinct characteristics and use cases:

- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):** In MAC, access permissions are determined by a central authority based on predetermined security policies. It's commonly used in environments that require a high level of security, such as government institutions. MAC enforces strict controls because users cannot modify access policies.

- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** DAC allows resource owners to dictate who can access their resources. It's flexible but vulnerable to improper settings if not managed correctly. File systems typically use DAC to allow file owners to modify access permissions.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** RBAC assigns permissions to roles rather than individual users, simplifying management in environments with numerous users. Users acquire permissions based on their role, which aligns with their job functions within the organization.

Identifying weaknesses in access control implementations is crucial in offensive cybersecurity. Common vulnerabilities include excessive permissions, improper inheritance of privileges, and misconfigured roles. Test environments can be used to craft access definitions, simulating different scenarios for a thorough understanding of how these controls work and where they might fail.

## Deciphering Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Access Control Lists (ACLs) define which users or system processes can access certain resources and under what conditions. ACLs work by checking a list of permissions or rules whenever a request for resource access is made. Key components include:

- **Syntax and Mechanics of ACLs:** ACLs use a specific syntax to define rules, often consisting of "allow" or "deny" commands, followed by specifications for who/what is allowed the access and the type of access permitted. For example, a network ACL might specify IP addresses or subnets allowed to interact with a system.

- **Exploiting Misconfigurations:** Misconfigured ACLs can allow unauthorized access or block legitimate access, making them targets for attackers. Common misconfigurations include incorrect order of rules, overly broad permissions, or failure to update ACLs to reflect changes in network architecture.

- **Tools for ACL Enumeration and Analysis:** Penetration testers use tools such as `nmap` for network-related ACL analysis, and access check utilities for systems ACLs, such as `Get-Acl` in PowerShell, to evaluate existing configurations and identify potential entry points.

## Techniques for Bypassing Access Controls

Techniques to bypass access controls involve manipulating weaknesses or design oversights in the access control framework:

- **Circumventing Network Layer Restrictions:** Attackers may use tunneling protocols or encapsulation methods to bypass firewall rules. Another method is using alternate communication routes or protocols that the ACLs do not scrutinize.

- **User and Resource Hijacking:** By exploiting permission bypasses, attackers may escalate their privileges within a network. This could involve session fixation attacks in web applications or leveraging a user's credentials for unauthorized access.

- **Targeted Exploitation of ACL Misconfigurations:** Attackers identify and exploit specific ACL misconfigurations, such as accessing services with residual default configurations that an administrator neglected to refine.

## Privilege Escalation via Access Control Mismanagement

Privilege escalation involves gaining elevated access to resources that were not initially intended for the user, often due to poor ACL management:

- **Internal Movement Through ACL Weaknesses:** Attackers move laterally within a network by exploiting improperly configured ACLs, allowing them to access additional compartments of a system.

- **Sniffing Permissions Leakage:** Information leakage through permissions, such as over-permissive file shares, can expose sensitive data and lead to privilege escalation attacks.

- **Pivoting Through Misconfigured ACLs:** Attackers use accessible systems as a starting point to reach otherwise restricted network areas, leveraging ACL gaps for strategic moves.

## Securing a Foothold Exploiting Access Controls

Once access is gained, attackers must maintain their position and avoid detection:

- **Establishing Persistence:** Attackers install backdoors or create alternate user accounts under the radar using existing permissions inappropriately granted by ACLs.

- **Maintaining Covert Access:** Leveraging ACL settings to remain concealed within the network, attackers utilize legitimate channels masked among approved communications.

- **Manipulating Logs:** To avoid detection, attackers alter logs or influence how activities appear in monitoring systems, often exploiting ACL-based log management oversights.

## Real-Time Access Control Monitoring and Reaction

Attackers may respond to or exploit dynamic changes in access control configurations:

- **Scanning for Active Control Changes:** Continuous monitoring helps identify changes to ACLs, indicating potential administrator actions or attempts to thwart access.

- **Reacting to Dynamic ACL Configurations:** Savvy attackers adapt their strategies to shifting access rules, using tools that provide real-time feedback on these modifications.

- **Automated Tools for Monitoring ACLs:** Tools such as `wireshark` or custom scripts can automate the monitoring of ACL changes in live environments, helping attackers stay one step ahead or cover their tracks effectively.
