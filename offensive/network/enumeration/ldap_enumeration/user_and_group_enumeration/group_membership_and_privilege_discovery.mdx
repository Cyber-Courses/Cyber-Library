# Group Membership and Privilege Discovery

## Active Directory Group Enumeration

In Active Directory (AD), group enumeration is critical for understanding security configurations and potential attack vectors. By utilizing tools such as `ldapsearch`, security professionals can extract comprehensive information about group structures within a Windows domain environment. This process involves querying the AD using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to retrieve attributes associated with group objects. When performing these queries, it is essential to capture not only direct group memberships but also nested groups, which can obscure the true extent of user privileges.

Example command to enumerate groups using `ldapsearch`:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<AD_SERVER> -D "<DOMAIN_USER>" -w "<PASSWORD>" -b "dc=<DOMAIN>,dc=com" "(objectClass=group)" dn member
```

Upon gathering the group data, analyze the output for nested group memberships and unexpected inclusions, which can represent indirect privilege escalation paths. Understanding these complexities is key to uncovering hidden vulnerabilities in group configurations.

## Privilege Audit via LDAP Queries

Beyond simple enumeration, this step involves executing LDAP queries to specifically identify group memberships tied to privileged user accounts, such as members of the Domain Admins group. These queries should also target default and lesser-known built-in groups, which might have extensive permissions but are frequently overlooked during security audits.

A sample LDAP query to list members of a privileged group:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<AD_SERVER> -D "<DOMAIN_USER>" -w "<PASSWORD>" -b "ou=Groups,dc=<DOMAIN>,dc=com" "(cn=Domain Admins)" member
```

Evaluate the query results against the expected privilege assignments as defined by the organization’s security policy. This audit helps in promptly identifying deviations from standard privilege assignments, indicating potential misconfigurations or unauthorized level permissions.

## Cross-Reference Group Memberships with Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Access Control Lists (ACLs) dictate permission levels and control access to resources based on group memberships. Thus, cross-referencing enumerated group memberships with ACLs on critical resources can reveal inconsistencies where users may have unintended levels of access. This investigation involves extracting ACLs from resources such as file shares, systems, and applications, and mapping them against the group membership data.

For example, Windows environments provide tools like `Get-ACL` in PowerShell to extract this information:

```powershell
Get-ACL -Path \\Server\Share | Format-List
```

By comparing this output with group membership enumerations, a cybersecurity professional can detect discrepancies between intended and actual access, highlighting potential security gaps or misconfigurations.

## Azure Active Directory Group Enumeration

In cloud environments, such as Azure Active Directory (AAD), group enumeration presents unique challenges and opportunities. Security professionals should utilize Azure-specific tools like Azure PowerShell or third-party scripts to conduct comprehensive group investigations. These tools allow for insights into both cloud-only and synchronized on-premises groups.

PowerShell example to list Azure AD groups:

```powershell
Get-AzureADGroup -All $true
```

Differences in how privileges are assigned in AAD, compared to on-premises AD, necessitate a separate audit path. It's important to capture distinctions in privilege designation, particularly as they relate to built-in roles and cloud resource governance.

## Identifying Misconfigured Privileged Groups

Misconfigurations are a common source of vulnerabilities. By analyzing group permissions, professionals can trace excessive permissions that may have resulted from improper configuration. Focus should be placed on administrative groups, backup operators, and service accounts with elevated access, as these groups are frequent targets for privilege abuse.

Misconfiguration often appears in the form of unused permissions, incorrect inheritance, or overly broad group memberships. Addressing these issues requires both a technical review of group policies and a review of access logs.

## Dynamic Group Membership Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of group memberships allows for real-time detection of unauthorized changes or suspicious privilege elevation. Utilizing tools that provide alerts upon changes in group membership is essential to maintaining robust security postures. This process typically involves setting up scheduled tasks or real-time scripts that compare current group states to a known baseline.

Tools like SIEM systems can integrate with LDAP to provide automated alerts and comprehensive change management:

```bash
python ldap_monitor.py --server <AD_SERVER> --base "dc=<DOMAIN>,dc=com" --watch
```

Such monitoring ensures that any attempted unauthorized modification is swiftly detected and mitigated.

## Privilege Escalation Path Mapping

Mapping group memberships onto known privilege escalation paths provides a visual representation of potential attack vectors within an organization’s domain. By understanding these paths, security professionals can prioritize defensive measures to protect against privilege-based exploits.

This activity involves the creation of visual diagrams (e.g., using tools like Bloodhound) that highlight the relationships and trust boundaries within group memberships:

```shell
neo4j start && bloodhound --domain <DOMAIN> --collector All
```

These visual maps facilitate the detection of complex chains that, if executed, could lead to elevated system privileges.

## Defense Evasion via Group Manipulation

Crafting methods to alter group memberships temporarily is a sophisticated tactic for evading detection during offensive operations. Such manipulations change memberships to achieve necessary access, then revert changes swiftly to remain hidden. Temporary association with privileged groups allows attackers to execute specific tasks without maintaining a prolonged presence in audit logs.

One common technique involves identifying gaps in security monitoring that allow unlogged group membership changes, emphasizing the need for tamper-proof logging solutions that can detect even temporary alterations.

In conclusion, the discovery and enumeration of group memberships and privileges form the foundation of a comprehensive offensive cybersecurity strategy, enabling detailed insights into potential security misconfigurations and tactical advantages in a domain environment.
