# Service and Version Detection in LDAP Enumeration

## Network Scanning for LDAP Services

### Nmap Scanning Techniques

Performing network scans to detect LDAP services is fundamental in identifying potential entry points within a target network. Nmap, a powerful and widely used network scanner, is instrumental for this task. To effectively identify LDAP services, one must understand how to leverage Nmap's capabilities.

- **Performing Network Scans with Nmap**: Initiate a basic network scan targeting well-known LDAP ports while utilizing Nmap’s ability to discover open ports and services. A typical command is:
  ```
  nmap -sV -p 389,636 [target]
  ```
  The `-sV` flag enables version detection, while `-p` specifies the LDAP ports 389 (LDAP) and 636 (LDAPS).

- **Identifying LDAP-specific Ports and Protocols**: Customize Nmap scans to pinpoint services running on uncommon ports or using unexpected protocols. Enabling the `-p-` option forces Nmap to scan all available ports:
  ```
  nmap -sV -p- --script ldap-rootdse [target]
  ```
  Libraries containing specific scripts like `ldap-rootdse` can provide further insights into LDAP implementations.

- **Customizing Nmap Scripts for LDAP Discovery**: Take advantage of Nmap's scripting engine (NSE) for advanced LDAP queries. Utilize scripts such as `ldap-search` to perform detailed searches directly:
  ```
  nmap --script ldap-search -p 389 [target]
  ```
  These scripts facilitate more granular LDAP information retrieval beyond basic service detection.

### Alternative Scanning Tools

For environments where traditional scanning methodologies are insufficient or too slow, alternate tools may provide an advantage due to their unique mechanisms and lighter footprints.

- **Exploring LDAP Enumeration with Masscan**: Masscan offers a faster scan engine, enabling it to cover large IP ranges swiftly. Configure Masscan to discover LDAP services:
  ```
  masscan -p389,636 [network range] --rate [requests per second]
  ```
  Adjust the rate according to the target’s network capacity to prevent detection.

- **Utilizing Unicornscan for Network Fingerprinting**: Leverage Unicornscan for extensive network traffic analysis and fingerprinting. Use customized service probes to gather service-specific information effectively:
  ```
  unicornscan -mU -p 389,636 [target]
  ```
  Here, `-mU` denotes UDP mode, useful in UDP service detection scenarios.

## LDAP Protocol and Port Identification

### LDAP over TCP/IP

Identification of services typically involves recognizing not only the service itself but also details about the protocols and ports in use.

- **Recognizing Default and Non-standard LDAP Ports**: LDAP predominantly utilizes TCP ports 389 and 636 for standard and secure transmissions, respectively. However, network administrators may modify these ports:
  ```
  nmap -p 1-65535 -sV --open [target]
  ```
  A full-range port scan ensures any non-standard port usage is identified.

- **Analyzing Traffic on Port 389 (LDAP) and 636 (LDAPS)**: Investigate open ports to discern LDAP services and differentiate between plaintext and encrypted traffic. Monitor transmission signatures using packet capture tools such as Wireshark.

### Detection of LDAP over Other Protocols

LDAP functionalities can be encapsulated within other protocols, complicating detection efforts.

- **Identifying LDAP over HTTP(S) and Global Catalog**: Spot LDAP referrals over HTTP/S by scrutinizing web traffic for characteristic traffic patterns on ports 3268 and 3269:
  ```
  curl -v -I [target]:3268
  ```
  This initial request may reveal a server’s LDAP support embedded within HTTP/S responses.

## Version Detection and Service Banner Analysis

### Analyzing Service Banners

Glean valuable version information by meticulously analyzing service banners presented during service interaction.

- **Extracting Version Information from Service Banners**: Use tools such as Nmap’s `-sV` option or Netcat to interact directly with open ports:
  ```
  nc [target] 389
  ```
  This direct communication often introduces service banners that reveal version data.

- **Automating Banner Grabbing with Scripting**: Automate repetitive banner analysis tasks by crafting scripts to log interactions and extract response headers across multiple targets.

### Protocol Version Detection Tools

Identifying protocol versions helps ascertain security features or vulnerabilities present in the service stack.

- **Employing Netcat for Manual Version Extraction**: Netcat serves as a basic tool for manual connection efforts, establishing basic communication with the service to provoke version disclosures.

- **Using Telnet for Direct Service Interaction**: Similar to Netcat, Telnet can be utilized for direct connections and assessing remote service banners:
  ```
  telnet [target] 389
  ```
  While phased out from many environments due to security concerns, it remains effective in controlled analyses.

## Advanced LDAP Fingerprinting

### OS and Service Enumeration Techniques

Further refined enumeration involves extracting more detailed insights from LDAP responses to construct a profile of the underlying systems.

- **Inferring Operating System from LDAP Responses**: Specific LDAP responses provide cues regarding the operating system from which the service is operating. Collect response characteristics to align them with known OS-specific banners.

- **Leveraging Specific Queries for Precise Fingerprinting**: Issue deliberately crafted LDAP queries to elicit OS-specific features that can narrow down the underlying infrastructure specifics. Queries may involve common schema elements or attributes unique to certain OS versions.

### TLS/SSL Version and Cipher Detection

Assessments of encryption methods provide clarity on security postures.

- **Checking for TLS/SSL Support and Configurations**: Use TLS scanning tools like OpenSSL or testssl.sh to query LDAPS endpoints and confirm the supported protocols and configurations:
  ```
  openssl s_client -connect [target]:636 -tls1_2
  ```
  This command tests TLS version compliance across the service.

- **Identifying Weak Cipher Suites in LDAP Implementations**: Determine weak or vulnerable cipher suites using dedicated tools or Nmap’s `--script ssl-enum-ciphers`.

## Scripted LDAP Enumeration

### Scripting with Python for Service Detection

Creating scripts for customized LDAP queries supports more extensive and in-depth enumeration.

- **Developing Custom Scripts for LDAP Service Queries**: Leverage Python libraries, such as `ldap3`, to automate LDAP queries and results parsing:
  ```python
  from ldap3 import Server, Connection
  server = Server('[target]', port=389, get_info='ALL')
  connection = Connection(server)
  connection.bind()
  ```
  These scripts automate the connection and information retrieval process.

- **Implementing Automated Service Detection with LDAP Libraries**: Build tailored solutions using Python or other scripting languages to repeatedly probe and analyze LDAP services efficiently.

## Correlating Findings for Attack Planning

### Linking Version Information to Exploits

Determine potential vulnerabilities by aligning version data with known exploits.

- **Matching Detected LDAP Versions to Known Vulnerabilities**: Consult vulnerability databases and advisories to cross-reference identified versions and potential exploits. Exploit-DB and CVE lists are instrumental in this research phase.

- **Prioritizing Exploitable Services for Attack Vectors**: Highlight and organize detected services based on vulnerabilities and exploit potential for focused attack planning and further enumeration efforts.

### Integration with Related Enumeration Tactics

### Domain and Organizational Unit (OU) Enumeration

Utilize gathered version information to streamline OU enumeration initiatives by refining LDAP search filters optimized for the server’s version.

### User and Group Enumeration

Capitalize on identified services to deploy more targeted user and group enumeration scripts, leveraging known vulnerabilities or service characteristics for deeper penetration.

### Schema and Attribute Discovery

Enhance schema analysis and attribute discovery activities through insights gained from precise service and version detection. Use the identified service configurations to craft queries that exploit the known weaknesses specific to the service stack.
