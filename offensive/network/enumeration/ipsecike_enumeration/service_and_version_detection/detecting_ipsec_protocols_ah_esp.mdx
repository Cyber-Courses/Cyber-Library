# Detecting IPsec Protocols (AH, ESP)

## Overview of IPsec Protocols

IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is a protocol suite for secure Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet during a communication session. Within IPsec, two primary protocols provide this security: Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). AH is responsible for providing connectionless integrity and data origin authentication for IP datagrams and prevents replays. It ensures the integrity and authenticity of the IP packets. On the other hand, ESP encrypts and optionally authenticates IP packets, providing confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

The distinction between the two lies mainly in their functionality; AH provides authentication and integrity but does not support encryption, while ESP supports encryption along with optional authentication.

## Probing Techniques for IPsec

Detecting IPsec protocols involves identifying unique network signatures and configurations. This can be executed through packet crafting tools such as Scapy, which allow the crafting and sending of custom packets to probe a network. By analyzing the network's response, it's possible to infer the presence of IPsec components. For instance, sending specifically crafted packets targeting port 500/udp or 4500/udp can simulate and probe standardized IPsec ports. Observing the network's responses can indicate active components of an IPsec setup.

In practice, this involves crafting packets that intentionally trigger responses indicative of IPsec configuration. The analysis of these responses helps in identifying whether AH or ESP is in use.

## Signature Detection in Network Traffic

Identifying signatures in network traffic is critical for detecting AH and ESP. Each IPsec protocol maintains distinct header formats and patterns in network traffic that can be discerned using tools such as Wireshark. To detect AH, for example, observe for IP packets with protocol number 51. For ESP, check packets with protocol number 50. These protocol numbers uniquely identify the presence of each protocol, respectively.

Using Wireshark, filters can be applied to isolate traffic by these protocol numbers, allowing further analysis of the packet headers. Traffic patterns and message sizes can help confirm the presence and the extent of AH or ESP in the observed network traffic.

## Active Scanning for IPsec Services

Active forms of scanning are leveraged to detect IPsec services explicitly. Tools such as Nmap can be employed to send packets destined for IPsec-associated ports (usually 500 and 4500). Nmap scripts like `ipsec-check` are available to delve into IPsec service detection, which can be particularly valuable for distinguishing between AH and ESP configurations.

An example Nmap command to scan for IPsec services could be:

```bash
nmap -sU -p 500,4500 --script ipsec-check <target_ip>
```

This command actively seeks out IPsec services by scanning the designated IPsec ports.

## Passive Identification of IPsec Traffic

Passive identification involves monitoring network traffic without injecting packets into the network, using tools like Zeek or specialized IPsec analyzers. By capturing ongoing traffic, analysts can identify IPsec flows based on typical parameters such as specific protocol numbers (50 for ESP, 51 for AH). Passive analysis focuses on traffic characteristics like IP header differences that align with AH or ESP usage.

With these tools, log files can be analyzed to identify probable IPsec sessions, thereby recognizing potential IPsec deployments without active probing.

## Dealing with Encryption in IPsec

When traffic is encrypted, direct analysis might not reveal details about the IPsec protocols in use. In such instances, the focus shifts towards traffic metadata, such as negotiation stages during the connection setup. During the IPsec negotiation phase, packets exchanged can provide indicators of the type of IPsec protocol in use.

By monitoring IKE (Internet Key Exchange) sessions and their negotiation messages, analysts can ascertain which IPsec protocols are being initiated. Traffic analysis tools capable of interpreting IKE negotiations are critical here.

## Bypassing Firewalls and Filtering Mechanisms

Firewalls often block or filter IPsec probe attempts. To bypass such obstacles, techniques like IP fragmentation and tunneling can be employed. These methods involve segmenting traffic into smaller packets or encapsulating probing packets within other traffic types to evade detection or blocking by firewalls.

Understanding baseline network operation and leveraging techniques like TTL expiration can facilitate stealthy probing even in heavily monitored networks.

## Exploitation Opportunities Post-Detection

Upon detecting AH or ESP, potential exploit paths can be considered, such as exploiting misconfigurations or older protocol vulnerabilities, like improper key management or weak encryption algorithms. The identification of weak spots in IPsec setups can lead to hijacking, decrypting, or injecting data into IPsec-encrypted streams.

In offensive operations, tools like Ettercap can be utilized for man-in-the-middle attacks against poorly configured IPsec implementations.

## Tools and Scripts for Automation

Automating the detection operations can be achieved with customized scripts and tools that continuously scan for IPsec-related activities. Popular network scanning tools like Nmap, complemented by custom scripts, facilitate ongoing surveillance for AH and ESP on targeted networks.

For example, integrating periodic Nmap scans with custom scripts can provide automated alerts on the detection of IPsec services.

## Continuous Monitoring Strategies

Establishing a framework for continuous monitoring helps detect IPsec deployments even as they evolve. Employing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) that can recognize IPsec patterns and integrating them with real-time analytics platforms ensures timely detection and response to IPsec traffic.

This continuous monitoring can prevent and alert on newly established IPsec configurations that could be vulnerable to attacks or misconfigurations.
