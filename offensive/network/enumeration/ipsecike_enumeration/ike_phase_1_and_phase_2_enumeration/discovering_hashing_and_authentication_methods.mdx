## Discovering Hashing and Authentication Methods

### IKE (Internet Key Exchange) Overview

The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol plays a crucial role in the IPsec suite by facilitating the secure exchange of cryptographic keys between parties wishing to establish a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. IKE comes in two main versions: IKEv1 and IKEv2. IKEv1 was the original incarnation and is detailed in several RFCs, while IKEv2 addresses some of the limitations of its predecessor, offering more robust security features and improved performance metrics.

IKE's primary function is to establish and maintain a Security Association (SA) which defines the parameters for encryption and authentication between communicating peers. This involves negotiating different cryptographic material, including encryption algorithms, hashing methods, and authentication mechanisms.

### Phase 1 and Phase 2 Negotiation

IKE performs in two essential negotiation phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 is concerned with establishing a secure and authenticated channel between parties. During this phase, the peers negotiate ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol) parameters and mutually authenticate using either a Pre-Shared Key (PSK), digital signature, or public key cryptography method. The secure channel established in Phase 1 serves to protect subsequent Phase 2 communications.

Phase 2, also known as Quick Mode in IKEv1, finalizes the details of the IPsec SA, negotiated under the protection of the tunnel established in Phase 1. The essential task during this phase is to agree on the parameters necessary for encrypting the actual data traffic. This includes finalizing the hashing algorithm to ensure data integrity during transmission.

### Passive Traffic Analysis

To discover the hashing and authentication methods supported by a target system, passive traffic analysis allows attackers to intercept IKE traffic for evaluation. Tools like Wireshark or tcpdump can be configured to capture and dissect Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) packets.

When using Wireshark, configuring display filters to focus solely on IKE packets will help reduce noise and zero in on pertinent exchanges. These captured packets frequently contain the complete plaintext modes of negotiation, including supported encryption, hashing algorithms, and proposed authentication methods.

### Active Probing Techniques

In addition to passive analysis, active probing techniques are crucial for comprehensive enumeration. Tools such as ike-scan can be deployed to send customized probe packets to VPN gateways to elicit responses indicative of their supported hashing and authentication configurations.

For example, executing the following ike-scan command:

```bash
ike-scan -M <target_ip>
```

will probe for Main Mode transactions, potentially elucidating specific detail about accepted proposals by generating response payloads.

### Extracting Supported Hashing Algorithms

Breaking down response payloads typically reveals the supported hashing algorithms advertised during IKE negotiations. Using the extracted hashes, attackers can evaluate the cryptographic strength inherent in algorithm choices such as SHA1 or SHA256. Weaknesses associated with these methods, such as the computational cost required for preimage resistance, can guide derivation for subsequent exploitation strategies.

Additionally, tools capable of decrypting IKE messages, such as those supporting dictionary or brute-force attacks against weak configurations, can be integrated to automate the decryption of intercepted traffic.

### Identifying Authentication Methods

By examining the AUTH payloads within IKE communication exchanges, attackers can discern the authentication methods employed. Common methods include PSK, RSA signatures, and DSS signatures. Each method presents different attack vectors related to their implementation.

For example, PSK configurations can be subjected to dictionary attacks, especially if weak passwords are in use. Moreover, improperly implemented digital certificates can be manipulated to bypass authentication phases.

### Coordinating with Encryption Algorithm Identification

Combining findings regarding hashing and authentication methods with previously enumerated encryption algorithms allows attackers to form a comprehensive view of a VPN's security posture. Identifying specific algorithmic combinations can highlight configuration weaknesses ripe for exploitation.

### Orchestrating Full Attack Vectors

Armed with details about the supported hashing, encryption, and authentication algorithms, attackers can design a complete attack strategy that exploits weak configurations. For instance, identifying the use of weak hashing combined with insufficient authentication mechanisms could culminate in successful man-in-the-middle attacks or decryption of protected communications, providing further access into the target network infrastructure.
