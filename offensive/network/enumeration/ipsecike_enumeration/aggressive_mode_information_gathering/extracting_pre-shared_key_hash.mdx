# Extracting Pre-Shared Key Hash

### Understanding IKE Aggressive Mode

Aggressive Mode in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol is a method for establishing a secure connection between network devices. It achieves a faster key exchange by omitting some security steps found in Main Mode. However, this efficiency comes at the cost of reduced security, as it exposes more information during the exchange process. Unlike Main Mode, Aggressive Mode transmits identities in clear text, increasing the risk of exposure to the network attacker.

In Aggressive Mode, the initiator sends a packet containing a list of cryptographic proposals, a Diffie-Hellman public key, a nonce, and an identity payload all in one go. The responder replies with its choice of cryptography proposal, another Diffie-Hellman half, a second nonce, and optionally an identity payload. Finally, the initiator confirms the choice. The pre-shared key (PSK) hash, which verifies both parties' possession of the shared secret, may be extracted during this exchange.

### Identifying Aggressive Mode Usage

Identification of Aggressive Mode in network traffic involves analyzing Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) messages. Specific indicators, such as a smaller number of message exchanges (three instead of six), help in detection. Analyzing network data for such messages can be accomplished using protocol analysis tools like Wireshark, which allows for filtering based on UDP port 500 used by ISAKMP.

These network analyzers can be configured to trigger alerts or log entries when Aggressive Mode communications are detected. By setting filters to look for the specific exchange characteristics of Aggressive Mode (such as message ID and exchange type), it is possible to isolate potential targets for hash extraction.

### Traffic Capture Techniques

For effective extraction of pre-shared key hashes, capturing the initial SA negotiation in the Aggressive Mode handshake is crucial. Network sniffers, such as tcpdump or Wireshark, can be configured to monitor and capture IPsec/IKE traffic on specific interfaces. Filters should be set to capture only the IKE traffic over UDP port 500, thus reducing the volume of captured data that needs analysis.

Example command using tcpdump:
```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 udp port 500 -w ike_traffic.pcap
```

After capture, the handshake packets to focus on are those containing the key exchange and identity payloads. This capture should include all three messages of the Aggressive Mode negotiation to provide the necessary data for hash extraction.

### Extracting Hash from Captured Traffic

Specialized tools must be employed to extract hashes from captured IKE traffic. Utilities like `ike-scan` or `pike` are tailored for parsing these handshake messages to identify and extract the pre-shared key hash. By feeding the recorded traffic data into such tools, one can parse through the ISAKMP exchanges and extract hashes for further analysis. `ike-scan` offers functionality to not only detect aggressive mode but to extract the necessary payloads:

Example command using ike-scan:
```bash
ike-scan -A --pskcrack ike_traffic.pcap
```

This command scans for Aggressive Mode and initiates the process of extracting potential PSK hashes from the provided capture file.

### Analyzing Extracted Pre-Shared Key Hashes

The extracted hash will correspond to the negotiated parameters of the IKE exchange. The commonly used hash algorithms, such as MD5 or SHA-1, can vary based on the encryption suite chosen during handshake. Distinguishing which algorithm was used is crucial for successful cracking attempts. Once extracted, information about the hash type and potential salting can often be identified through analysis of the IKE payload parameters or vendor-specific details.

### Post-Extraction Steps

Upon extracting the hash, the next step involves preparing it for offline cracking attempts. The extracted hash is often stored in a format compatible with hash-cracking software, and preparation may include format conversion or normalization. Hash analysis tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper can be employed for these purposes, providing utility scripts to transform data as needed for their attacks.

Example preparation command:
```bash
echo "EXTRACTED_HASH" > hash.txt
```

### Hash Cracking Strategies

Cracking the pre-shared key from an IKE Aggressive Mode hash is a resource-intensive task. Utilizing pre-computed hash resources, such as rainbow tables, can provide significant efficiency in these efforts. Distributed cracking setups, using tools like Hashcat, leverage the computational power of multiple systems to accelerate the attack process.

Example command using Hashcat:
```bash
hashcat -m 5300 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hash.txt wordlist.txt
```

Here, the `-m 5300` parameter specifies cracking of IKE-PSK hashes, and `wordlist.txt` contains potential pre-shared keys.

### Improving Process Efficiency

To streamline the hash extraction and cracking process, automation via scripting can significantly enhance efficiency. By developing automated scripts that integrate capture, extraction, and preparation tasks, time and manual intervention are minimized. Tools like scapy in Python can automate packet capture and analysis, providing a continuous, efficient workflow for identifying and extracting pre-shared key hashes from network streams.

```python
from scapy.all import *

def capture_ike_traffic(interface):
    packets = sniff(iface=interface, filter="udp port 500", count=10)
    wrpcap('ike_traffic.pcap', packets)

capture_ike_traffic('eth0')
```

Integrating these tools and techniques into a cohesive strategy allows offensive security professionals to quickly identify and exploit vulnerabilities exposed by IKE Aggressive Mode negotiations, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of their security assessments.
