## Extracting Pre-Shared Key Hash

### Understanding IKE and IPsec Protocols

Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is a protocol used to set up a secure and authenticated communication channel between two parties over an IPsec VPN. IPsec, or Internet Protocol Security, facilitates secure encrypted communication over the internet by authenticating and encrypting each packet in a communication session. IKE operates in two phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2, where Phase 1 is responsible for authenticating the peers and setting up a secure channel for further communication. Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs) are one of the primary methods for authenticating peers in Phase 1 of IKE.

PSK in IKE Aggressive Mode is integral to the initiation of secure exchanges between parties. Unlike Main Mode, which provides encryption of identities, Aggressive Mode trades security for speed, making the PSK hash potentially vulnerable. Extracting the PSK hash can allow an attacker to attempt a brute-force attack to recover the original key, which can be then used for unauthorized access to the VPN.

### Aggressive Mode Characteristics

IKE Aggressive Mode is characterized by fewer packet exchanges compared to Main Mode (three instead of six), which facilitates faster handshake times but at the cost of reduced security. In Aggressive Mode, the initial two packets carry almost all the required attributes, including the PSK hash, which is exposed and can be intercepted by attackers.

The key vulnerability of Aggressive Mode lies in the exposure of the PSK hash early in the exchange process and without identity protection, making interception and extraction feasible. If the hash is captured, attackers can undertake offline brute-force attacks to discover the pre-shared key used for authentication.

### Tools for Observing IKE Aggressive Mode Traffic

Observing IKE traffic involves capturing the packets that constitute the handshake between the communicating parties. Tools like **Wireshark** and **tcpdump** are essential for capturing raw network traffic. These tools allow you to filter and analyze the network traffic specifically for IKE protocols.

For more targeted observation and interrogation of IKE packets, tools such as **ike-scan** and modules from **strongSwan** provide functionalities tailored for examining Aggressive Mode traffic. These tools enable penetration testers to identify IKE communication and extract relevant data, including the PSK hash from the traffic.

### Capturing IKE Handshake

1. **Setting Up Network Sniffers**: Network sniffers like Wireshark are configured to capture all traffic on the network interface connected to the VPN endpoint. Filters are applied to focus on traffic to and from the IP addresses involved in the IKE exchange.

2. **Applying Filters**: Use display filters such as `udp.port == 500` to capture IKE Phase 1 traffic since UDP port 500 is commonly used for IKE negotiations.

3. **Ensuring Completeness**: Make sure the capture covers the entire handshake. Missing packets might lead to incomplete data, making hash extraction impossible.

### Extracting the Pre-Shared Key Hash

Using **ike-scan**, you can actively initiate and capture Aggressive Mode handshakes to extract the PSK hash. `ike-scan` sends IKE requests and can often provoke a response from the target IPsec gateway, thereby capturing the Aggressive Mode handshake.

```bash
ike-scan --mode=aggressive --pskcrack target_ip
```

This command identifies and captures the PSK hash by simulating an IKE exchange in Aggressive Mode with the targeted IP address.

### Validate Hash Extraction

To ensure the extracted hash's accuracy:
- Cross-reference the hash with alternative tools to confirm its integrity.
- Verification methods should include comparing hash lengths and matching expected hash types against simulated test environments.

### Decrypting the Hash

Once the hash is extracted, the next logical step is to decrypt it to determine the original PSK. The process generally involves guessing potential PSK values and hashing them using the same algorithm as the VPN to find a matchâ€”an approach akin to brute-forcing.

The choice of encryption algorithm affects how straightforward this process might be. For example, if SHA-1 was used, tools like **hashcat** can be employed to perform a brute-force attack against the hash.

```bash
hashcat -m 500 psk-hash.txt wordlist.txt
```

### Analysis and Next Steps

Post-decryption, the significant effort lies in analyzing the decrypted PSK and assessing the access it grants to the attacker. With an authenticated but unauthorized access point, you can proceed with further penetration tests against the VPN infrastructure, identifying potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

Ultimately, leveraging the extracted data for subsequent phases in a penetration test or ethical hacking operation can yield insight into the target network's security posture and lead to the discovery of exploitable weaknesses and the improvement of security measures.
