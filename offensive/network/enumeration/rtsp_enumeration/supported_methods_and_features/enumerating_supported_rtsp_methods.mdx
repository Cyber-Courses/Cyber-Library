# Enumerating Supported RTSP Methods

## Understanding RTSP Protocol

The Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) governs the setup and control of media streaming sessions between client devices and servers, defining how media streaming is implemented on the internet. Primarily operating at the application layer, RTSP is tailored to facilitate the exchange of control signals, leaving the transport of media to protocols like RTP (Real-Time Protocol) and RTCP (RTP Control Protocol). RTSP is inherently similar to HTTP, using commands to control media sessions, such as play, pause, and tear down. It operates over both TCP and UDP, where TCP is frequently used for control messages, ensuring reliability, while UDP caters to the media stream itself to preserve bandwidth efficiency.

Typical RTSP interactions involve requests and responses, where clients send method requests like `OPTIONS`, `DESCRIBE`, `PLAY`, etc., to the server. The server replies, sometimes requiring responses or further requests from the client. Each message includes headers and media-related parameters, aiding in session description, media streaming preparation, and security enforcement. Understanding these interactions is vital when engaging in enumeration activities since multiple entry points may reveal different levels of system information.

## Target Identification

Identifying potential RTSP endpoints within a network is an essential precursor to enumeration efforts. Enumeration endeavors begin with network discovery, where network scanning tools such as Nmap or Zenmap are employed to identify active devices and open ports, specifically looking for services running on the default RTSP port (TCP/554). RTSP streams may also exist on non-standard ports, necessitating scanning range adjustments.

During this process, implementing filters pertinent to RTSP can narrow down likely candidates. This includes using service detection (-sV) scans, and leveraging filtering syntax that singles out communication patterns indicative of RTSP protocol usage. Detection of RTSP communications frequently surfaces devices such as IP cameras, media servers, and networked DVRs, all of which commonly deliver RTSP functionality.

## Crafting RTSP OPTIONS Requests

A pivotal part of RTSP method enumeration is utilizing the `OPTIONS` request method. This request is the foundation for understanding available server capabilities as it prompts the server to respond with a list of supported methods within the `Public` header of the response. Crafting `OPTIONS` requests involves constructing proper RTSP requests that adhere to the standard protocol syntax, including a valid request line and necessary headers.

This process can be automated using scripting languages like Python and tools such as LibRTSP or RTSP libraries in languages like Ruby or Node.js, allowing for scalable enumeration across extensive ranges of targets. Automation ensures swift, accurate deployment of `OPTIONS` requests necessary in larger network scopes, minimizing manual oversight.

## Interpretation of RTSP Server Responses

Once an `OPTIONS` request is dispatched, interpreting the server's response is critical. Server responses will typically contain an RTSP version and a series of header fields. The core field of interest is the `Public` header, where supported methods are enumerated, often including methods like `DESCRIBE`, `ANNOUNCE`, `GET_PARAMETER`, `SET_PARAMETER`, `PLAY`, `PAUSE`, `TEARDOWN`, and potentially others specific to server configurations.

Understanding server variability is important, as larger infrastructures or unique deployments may result in customized servers, where deviations from the RTSP standard or proprietary extensions could occur. This necessitates flexibility in interpretation and analysis, ensuring comprehensive ability to delineate standard functionality from substance-specific implementations.

## Tools and Scripts for RTSP Method Enumeration

Tool selection is instrumental in effectively enumerating RTSP methods. Tools like `rtspclient`, `ffmpeg`, and `cURL` can issue `OPTIONS` requests and return supported methods efficiently. `Rtspclient` allows for a focused RTSP script interface, while `ffmpeg` offers broader media capabilities that encompass RTSP interrogation.

For custom enumeration requirements, scripting proves invaluable. Python scripts utilizing the `socket` module can swiftly execute crafted RTSP requests and parse responses, offering real-time feedback. Helper libraries that parse RTSP packets, like pRTSP, can accelerate development, integrate IPSec bypass, and enhance command-line options relevant under specific circumstances or defenses.

## Advanced RTSP Enumeration Techniques

Advanced RTSP enumeration involves overcoming layered security measures. Often, RTSP endpoints employ authentication schemes necessitating correct credentials. Familiarity with basic auth mechanisms like HTTP Digest Authentication can facilitate baseline access, but advanced methods may need exploration of vulnerabilities within auth systems or configuration errors.

Further, exploring non-standard methods, especially those added by vendors for proprietary functionality, can provide insights into potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Techniques like manipulating firewall rules or using source IP address spoofing can be useful in bypassing basic ACLs or addressing issues arising in more restrictive environments.

## Documentation and Reporting

The culmination of RTSP enumeration demands rigorous documentation to ensure clarity and continuity. A structured approach records all discovered methods, host details, and associated network nuances, promoting reproducibility and facilitating strategic objectives within ongoing operations.

Effective documentation involves detailed enumeration logs, a catalog of method support levels across hosts, and careful archiving of diverse server responses. With a focus on alignment with organizational offensive security goals, comprehensive reporting will outline discoveries, underscore potential risks, and inform decision-making processes for subsequent engagements or mitigations.
