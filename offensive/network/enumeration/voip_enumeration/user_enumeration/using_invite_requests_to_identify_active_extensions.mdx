# Using INVITE Requests to Identify Active Extensions

## Understanding INVITE Requests

INVITE requests are a fundamental component of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), serving as a mechanism to initiate a call setup by inviting users to participate in a conversation. An INVITE request contains several mandatory fields, including `Via`, `From`, `To`, `Call-ID`, `CSeq`, `Contact`, and message body as a Session Description Protocol (SDP) payload. These requests enable communication between clients and servers, facilitating the discovery of active extensions in a Voice over IP (VoIP) system. ENUM-based systems allow enumeration of users, enabling attackers to discover extensions associated with SIP users. When crafted appropriately, INVITE requests can reveal which extensions are in active use by analyzing the responses from the server.

## Crafting INVITE Requests for Enumeration

To craft an INVITE request for enumeration purposes, it must be structured with precise control over the SIP headers. The `To` header is used to specify the targeted extension, while the `From` header may spoof legitimate data to bypass superficial filters. Attention must be paid to headers such as `Max-Forwards` to prevent loop detection, which may prematurely terminate enumeration attempts. Other headers, such as `User-Agent` and `Contact`, should also be adjusted to mimic usual traffic and evade detection in environments with stringent security controls. Encapsulation techniques, including encoding certain fields, can help evade deep packet inspection by converting special characters into URI-encoded formats.

## SIP Response Codes and Their Importance

The server's response to an INVITE request conveys crucial information through standardized SIP response codes. Key codes that reveal extension status include `100 Trying`, `180 Ringing`, `404 Not Found`, and `486 Busy Here`. A `100 Trying` indicates the request is being processed, without initial extension feedback. If the code `180 Ringing` is returned, it discloses that the recipient of the INVITE request, in this case, the extension, exists and is active. Conversely, a `404 Not Found` communicates that the extension is inactive or nonexistent. Understanding these codes and their implications is vital in identifying active extensions through SIP INVITE enumeration.

## Automation with Scripts

Automation significantly enhances INVITE-based enumeration processes by facilitating repetitive and scalable request transmissions. Python scripts utilizing libraries like `sockets` and `scapy` enable direct manipulation of packet headers for crafting customized requests. A Bash script can similarly automate enum INVITE requests in environments where compiled languages are inconvenient to run. For instance, a command using `sippets` can send an automated INVITE:

```bash
sipts -s sip:1000@target-pbx -r INVITE --to sip:9999@target-pbx --from sip:attacker@roguepbx --contact sip:attacker@roguepbx
```

Such scripts automate the transmission of these requests, iterating through a range of extensions.

## Analyzing Response Behavior

INVITE request responses require careful analysis to distinguish genuine responses from decoys. Timing analysis can identify delays that malicious users may have inserted or uncover queuing complexities that provide clues to underlying architectures. Examination of header components reveals variances in server behaviorâ€”unexpected response headers might indicate responses spawned by honeypots or other traps. Variability in response time, differences in content length, and modified server signatures should all be scrutinized to ascertain false positives and increase the reliability of identifying active extensions.

## Bypassing Protections

To mitigate common defensive strategies, attackers often resort to tactics such as request rate throttling, which simulates legitimate user behavior to avoid pattern detection. By using headers altered to induce benign registry input or leveraging time-based attacks, attackers can evade firewall detection mechanisms. Utilizing malformed headers to exploit SIP stack handling inconsistencies within the server may further enhance the bypassing capacity. Exploiting flaws in regex-based filters by altering header sequence to avoid pattern detection is another frequent strategy.

## Real-Time Monitoring and Logging

Implementing real-time monitoring and logging enhances both offensive and defensive perspectives in the network. For attackers, capturing INVITE request traffic can be conducted via tools like Wireshark or Tshark, allowing packet stream analysis for pattern recognition. Setting up logging systems that record the response codes and correlate them based on timestamp and extension number helps maintain iterative catalogues of extension enumeration results. This not only refines techniques but also reinforces defenses by highlighting exposure points within an architecture.

## Best Practices and Operational Security

Maintaining a low profile during offensive operations involves a myriad of practices that circumvent detection. Techniques such as randomizing IP origins via VPNs or obscure proxy systems can obscure the point of attack initiation. Careful pacing of INVITE requests, using delay strategies to mimic latency, ensures that enumeration rhythms remain covert. Obfuscating User-Agent strings or mimicking legitimate traffic patterns enhances anonymity and minimizes the risk of raising alerts.

## Integration with Other Enumeration Techniques

Combining INVITE enumeration with other techniques fosters a holistic approach to SIP user enumeration. Techniques such as OPTIONS requests or REGISTER enumeration supplement INVITE's direct call attempts by surveying response capability and authentication demands. Synergizing results from these various methodologies can uncover more nuanced data structures, revealing potential vulnerabilities for subsequent exploitation within VoIP systems. By correlating data sets from multiple enumeration methods, an attacker can comprehensively map extension viability and hierarchy.
