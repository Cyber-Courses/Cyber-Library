### User Enumeration

#### Enumerating SIP Users via OPTIONS Requests

OPTIONS requests are a fundamental part of the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) used in VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) communications. When performing user enumeration, OPTIONS requests can help determine the existence of active SIP users on a network. This is achieved by sending OPTIONS requests to the SIP server, which can elicit responses indicating the presence of particular users.

To craft effective OPTIONS requests, it is essential to understand the structure and requirements of the SIP protocol. The OPTIONS request must include accurate SIP headers, such as `Via`, `From`, `To`, and `Contact`. Adjusting these headers can help bypass certain security measures and improve the chances of enumerating active users.

Analyzing responses to OPTIONS requests involves interpreting various SIP response codes. Codes such as `200 OK` often indicate that the specified user exists, while `404 Not Found` suggests otherwise. Distinguishing these response codes amidst diverse server configurations and user status scenarios is crucial for precise enumeration.

Automation can significantly enhance the efficiency of enumerating SIP users via OPTIONS requests. Tools like `sipvicious` or custom Python scripts can automate the sending and response-analysis processes, making it easier to handle large VOIP infrastructures. Customizing these tools to suit specific VOIP systems and infrastructure ensures comprehensive and effective enumeration.

#### Using INVITE Requests to Identify Active Extensions

The INVITE request is another integral component of the SIP protocol, primarily used to initiate a communication session. Within the context of user enumeration, INVITE requests can be utilized to identify active extensions by sending them across the network and analyzing the responses.

To make INVITE requests effective for enumeration, one must carefully structure them to avoid triggering security defenses. This involves crafting requests with well-defined `Via`, `From`, `To`, `Contact`, and `Call-ID` headers. Tuning these requests in terms of timing and frequency helps reduce detection risk during enumeration efforts.

Decoding responses from INVITE requests is crucial for identifying active extensions. Success indicators such as `100 Trying`, `180 Ringing`, or `200 OK` signal valid extensions, whereas `404 Not Found` indicates inactive or incorrect extensions. Efficient analysis of these responses allows the determination of network configuration and user availability.

Advanced automation techniques facilitate scaling of INVITE request enumeration across extensive VOIP setups. Automation tools, supplemented by parallel processing capabilities, can rapidly dispatch INVITE requests, improving the speed and comprehensiveness of the enumeration process.
