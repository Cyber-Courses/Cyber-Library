# Discovering VoIP Protocols in Use (SIP, H.323, etc.)

## VoIP Protocol Recognition Techniques

VoIP protocol recognition begins with the examination of unique identifiers present in packet headers. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) can typically be identified by the presence of the "INVITE" or "REGISTER" sequence, often found in the header of packets using ports such as 5060 and 5061. Similarly, H.323, which is another widely used VoIP protocol, exhibits distinct sequence patterns like "Q.931" and "H.245" within its packet structure.

Packet analysis tools like Wireshark are invaluable for detecting these signatures. By applying filters relevant to these identifiers (e.g., `sip` or `h225` in Wireshark), analysts can isolate traffic and discern protocol usage efficiently. Protocol-specific patterns such as the frequent GET messages in SIP or ACK signals can also provide substantial clues about the protocols being employed.

## Active Discovery Methods

Active discovery methods involve sending protocol-specific queries or packets towards network endpoints to determine the protocols supported or currently in use. For SIP, sending OPTIONS requests can help verify if a target responds with SIP protocol specifics. Crafting such requests can be efficiently managed through command-line tools like `sipsak` or scripting custom queries with Python and the `Scapy` library.

For H.323, tools like `hping3` can be utilized to craft H.225 probe packets. This method aids in revealing protocol support through the response evaluation. It's essential to craft these probes precisely to bypass firewall and NAT (Network Address Translation) configurations that may otherwise block traditional discovery attempts.

## Passive Traffic Analysis

Passive traffic analysis relies on capturing and analyzing ongoing network traffic to detect VoIP protocols. Tools like Tcpdump or Wireshark can be used to perform deep dives into packet data without altering network behavior. By configuring these tools to recognize VoIP-specific traffic characteristics—such as Call-ID for SIP sessions or gatekeeper discovery packets for H.323—investigators can identify protocol usage.

Analyzing VoIP call flows in real-time, or through recorded pcap files, allows users to discover protocols while leaving the network environment unchanged. This is particularly useful in environments where active scanning might be detected or obstructed.

## Protocol Fingerprinting with Custom Scripts

Creating custom scripts allows for a high degree of flexibility in protocol fingerprinting. Scripts tailored to mimic the behaviors of a VoIP client can induce responses from VoIP servers or endpoints, thus confirming the protocol in use. For SIP, a script might send a series of REGISTER or INVITE requests to known VoIP servers and confirm protocol based on response patterns.

For enhanced precision, these scripts can be integrated with libraries such as Python's `Scapy` for packet crafting and analysis. This approach ensures that fingerprinting efforts are both targeted and efficient, providing high accuracy in identifying active protocols.

## Analyzing Encrypted VoIP Traffic

VoIP communications are often encrypted using Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) or encapsulated within Transport Layer Security (TLS), complicating protocol identification. Despite encryption, metadata and unencrypted portions of traffic can still afford clues. Observing the handshake procedures of TLS or the distinct patterns of SRTP encryption headers can indicate protocol presence.

Analyzing features such as cipher suites or session initiation messages can help distinguish between encrypted SIP and other encrypted protocols. Moreover, leveraging capabilities in tools like `openssl` or `tshark` to analyze TLS records can reveal underlying VoIP activities, even when the media layer is secured.

## Behavioral Analysis for Protocol Detection

Behavioral analysis involves monitoring how network devices communicate to discern protocol patterns. Devices engaging in frequent, consistent session initiations on specific ports may suggest SIP usage, as these are characteristics of a SIP-based communication system. Similarly, identifying patterns like frequent "keep-alive" messages may point toward H.323 gatekeepers.

Implementing network monitoring solutions capable of statistical analysis can automate behavioral detection. This method can uncover less apparent protocol engagements, especially in networks where standard protocol signatures are obfuscated or altered deliberately.

## Cross-Referencing with Known Protocol Libraries

Cross-referencing captured packet signatures against comprehensive protocol libraries ensures that identifications are accurate and up to date. Libraries such as the VoIP Protocol Database, which contain known fingerprinting signatures of VoIP protocols, offer substantial resources for protocol verification.

Automated tools like `nmap` can utilize custom scripts to perform this cross-referencing, enhancing detection capabilities. By aligning observed network activity with updated libraries, users can definitively conclude which VoIP protocols are operating within the network environment, ensuring accurate security posturing and asset management.
