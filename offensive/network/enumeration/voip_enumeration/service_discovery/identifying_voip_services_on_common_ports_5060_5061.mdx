# Identifying VoIP Services on Common Ports (5060, 5061)

## Intermediate Network Scanning Techniques

### Nmap for VoIP Service Detection

Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool crucial for identifying VoIP services on common ports like 5060 and 5061. These ports are predominantly used by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for managing VoIP communications. Nmap can be employed to detect these services by utilizing its specialized Network Scanning Engine (NSE) scripts designed for VoIP service detection. Specifically, the `sip-methods` and `sip-enum-users` scripts help in identifying SIP servers and enumerating user accounts.

When scanning ports 5060 and 5061, it's important to select the correct protocol since SIP typically uses UDP on port 5060 and TCP on port 5061 for secure transmissions. Here is an example command for scanning these ports:

```bash
nmap -sU -p5060 --script=sip-methods <target>
nmap -sT -p5061 --script=ssl-cert,sip-methods <target>
```

These commands perform a UDP scan for SIP services on port 5060 and a TCP scan for port 5061 to detect Secure SIP (SIPS) with SSL/TLS configurations. Adjusting scan timing, using options such as `-T4`, can help manage performance during large network scans.

### Masscan for High-Speed VoIP Enumeration

Masscan is advocated for high-speed scans, making it ideal for initial discovery across large IP ranges when looking for VoIP services. The tool can be configured specifically for ports 5060 and 5061 to quickly identify potential SIP endpoints. An optimized configuration of Masscan includes a high packet rate and appropriate rate-limiting features to prevent network overwhelm:

```bash
masscan -pU:5060,T:5061 10.0.0.0/8 --rate 10000
```

Upon execution, Masscan provides a list of IP addresses responsive on the specified ports, which should be further evaluated using Nmap for service fingerprints.

## Analyzing SIP Services

### SIP Protocol Identification on Port 5060

SIP protocol variations running on port 5060 can be identified using network capture tools like Wireshark or through script-assisted fingerprinting with Nmap. Enabling detailed logging of captured SIP headers can help distinguish protocol versions and implementations, providing greater insight into the targeted VoIP infrastructure.

Use Nmap's NSE script for identifying accessible SIP methods:

```bash
nmap -sU -p5060 --script=sip-methods --reason <target>
```

This command will enumerate supported SIP methods and provide information about protocol versions.

### Secure SIP (SIPS) Detection on Port 5061

Port 5061 typically hosts SIPS, which involves secure SIP sessions established over TLS. Detection involves verifying SSL/TLS configurations and analyzing certificate details to determine server identity or vendor. Tools like `openssl` can be used to establish SSL connections to retrieve certificate information for analysis:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect <target>:5061
```

Interpreting the certificate information helps in identifying service details and server authenticity.

## Advanced Fingerprinting Techniques

### Banner Grabbing for VoIP Identification

Banner grabbing involves opening a connection to the service port and capturing any textual output sent by the server, often revealing client-server details like active protocols or specific service versions. Utilizing `netcat` can facilitate this task:

```bash
nc -u <target> 5060
```

Automating this process with scripts enables large-scale banner collection and analysis, parsing user-agent strings to determine vendor and version information.

### Service Version Identification

Nmap's service version detection (`-sV`) can be particularly useful in accurately identifying the service running on discovered ports, which is crucial for targeted exploitation:

```bash
nmap -sU -p5060,5061 -sV <target>
```

This command utilizes deep packet inspection to extract granular service details, leveraging knowledge bases for precise version identification. Additionally, tools like `sVmap` can refine this process by cross-referencing detected versions with known vulnerabilities.

## Handling Encrypted VoIP Traffic

### Decrypting SIP/TLS Traffic

Decrypting Secure SIP (SIPS) traffic necessitates acquiring encryption keys, involving either legal access to the endpoint configurations or exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities. Once decrypted, tools like Wireshark can be used:

- Importing keys into Wireshark for traffic decryption.
- Analyzing decrypted streams to inspect SIP requests and responses.

### Man-in-the-Middle Attacks for SIP/SIPS

Performing man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks allows interception of VoIP communications for analysis and manipulation. Setting up an ARP spoofing attack via tools like `Ettercap`, combined with a proxy setup, can intercept SIP messages for further evaluation. This approach requires ethical consideration and appropriate permissions.

## Post-Discovery Exploitation Preparation

### Vulnerability Assessment on Discovered Services

Following service identification, linking detected VoIP applications to known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) enables targeted testing. Nmap's `vulners` script or Metasploit can identify exploitable vulnerabilities:

```bash
nmap -sU -p5060 --script=vulners <target>
```

This process maps discovered services to associated risks, allowing security teams to focus remediation efforts effectively.

### Pivoting from Discovered VoIP Services

Exploiting vulnerabilities in VoIP services can facilitate lateral movement within a network, increasing an attack's scope and depth. Techniques to pivot might include exploiting weak authentication or firmware bugs to gain further access to internal systems, leveraging footholds gleaned from targeted VoIP equipment.
