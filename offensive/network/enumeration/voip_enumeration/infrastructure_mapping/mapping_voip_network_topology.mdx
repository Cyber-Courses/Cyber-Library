# Mapping VoIP Network Topology

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) networks are specialized environments that blend traditional telephony functions with internet-based protocols. Mapping their topology requires a combination of active and passive scanning techniques, detailed analysis, and methodical tracing of communication paths. This process helps in understanding the network for various purposes such as security assessments, performance optimization, and troubleshooting.

## Network Scanning for VoIP Components

### Active Scanning for VoIP Devices

Active scanning involves sending packets to target systems to solicit responses, which helps in identifying open services and their configurations. Tools like Nmap are essential for this purpose. With the addition of SIP-specific scripts, such as `sipsess`, `sip-enum-users`, and `sip-methods`, the process can be more targeted:

```bash
nmap -p 5060 --script=sip-enum-users <targetIP>
```

Start by scanning typical VoIP ports such as 5060 for SIP, 5061 for SIP over TLS, and 2000 for SCCP. Use protocols that minimize scan noise and deploy decoys to evade network intrusion detection systems whenever possible.

### Passive Scanning for VoIP Components

Passive analysis involves examining network traffic passively to infer the presence and configuration of VoIP nodes without directly interacting with them. Wireshark is invaluable in this context, as it can capture SIP/RTP flows and analyze them:

- Capture traffic and apply filters such as `sip` or `rtp` to narrow down the relevant packets.
- Monitor ARP and DNS requests to identify dynamic IP assignments for VoIP devices.

This approach ensures minimal disruption to the network and can often provide insight into the network's operational state.

## Identifying VoIP Nodes

### Detecting SIP Endpoints and IP Phones

SIP endpoints and IP phones can be detected by analyzing OPTIONS and REGISTER requests, which are part of the SIP protocol used for capability exchange and registration, respectively. By examining the headers of these SIP messages, particularly the `User-Agent` header, you can fingerprint and identify different devices.

### Source IP and Network Segment Identification

Determining which IPs and subnets are used for VoIP can involve conducting reverse DNS lookups to gather hostname information, often revealing naming conventions that highlight their purpose (e.g., `voip-server01.domain.com`). Subnet allocations can typically be deduced by analyzing traffic patterns and DHCP leases, which is crucial for understanding network segments dedicated to VoIP.

## Tracing VoIP Call Paths

### Mapping Call Flow Routes

Mapping call flows involves tracking SIP message exchanges such as INVITE, ACK, and BYE. Each message part of the sequence can provide details about the path a call takes through the network:

- Capture a call sequence using Wireshark and observe the order and content of SIP messages.
- Note the sequence numbers and timestamps, which help trace the path through proxies and servers.

### RTP Stream Analysis

RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) streams are used alongside SIP to handle media. Analyzing RTP involves looking for audio or video streams to pinpoint media gateways within the network:

- Wireshark can track RTP streams, display their latency, and show path details.
- Use `follow` features to correlate real-time data with SIP signals, strengthening topology assumptions.

## Enumerating Inter-Device Communication

### Service Interaction Mapping

SIP packets provide insights into how devices on the VoIP network interact. By analyzing registration messages:

- Notice patterns in how devices communicate with each other, focusing on SIP registrations, invites, and responses.
- Understand if any additional services like voicemail servers or call recording are present.

### Protocol Interoperability Observation

VoIP networks sometimes operate in a mixed-protocol environment. Observe communications through protocols like SCCP, H.323, and MGCP for legacy systems:

- Inspect how these protocols interact with more common SIP traffic.
- Look for mappings that signify a bridging function between modern and legacy systems.

## Network Topology Visualization

### Compiling Network Maps

Using the collected data, generate topology maps that show the layout of VoIP infrastructure. Tools like Graphviz can help visualize these paths clearly:

- Convert network traffic insights into graphical representations.
- Use node and link annotations to indicate device types and connectivity.

### Identifying Network Bottlenecks and Points of Failure

Analyze the topology to identify potential bottlenecks and failure points, which can affect call quality and network resilience. This analysis aids in:

- Understanding redundancy and load-balancing configurations.
- Spot light devices or pathways that constitute a single point of failure.

## Documenting Findings

### Creating Detailed Topology Reports

Structuring detailed topology reports involves compiling data into structured formats that highlight potential vulnerabilities, key interconnections, and communication flows:

- Use visual aids like diagrams to complement textual descriptions.
- Ensure reports include device roles, network segments, and highlighted discovery insights.

### Maintaining Updated Network Maps

Occasional changes in network configurations necessitate regular updates to topology maps to ensure they remain accurate:

- Implement monitoring solutions that automatically track network changes.
- Use automation scripts to update diagrams with organizational shifts promptly.

Comprehensive mapping of VoIP network topology is critical for maintaining an understanding of complex telephony infrastructures, supporting both defensive and offensive cybersecurity strategies.
