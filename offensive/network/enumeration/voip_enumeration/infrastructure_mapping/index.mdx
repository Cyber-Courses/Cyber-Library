## Infrastructure Mapping

In the realm of offensive cybersecurity, particularly within VoIP enumeration, infrastructure mapping is a crucial step in identifying and understanding the layout and components of a target VoIP network. Here, we delve into two essential subtopics that form the backbone of an effective infrastructure mapping strategy: [Identifying VoIP Gateways and PBX Servers](offensive/network/enumeration/voip_enumeration/infrastructure_mapping/identifying_voip_gateways_and_pbx_servers) and [Mapping VoIP Network Topology](offensive/network/enumeration/voip_enumeration/infrastructure_mapping/mapping_voip_network_topology).

### Identifying VoIP Gateways and PBX Servers

VoIP gateways and PBX servers serve as the central nodes in VoIP communications. Identifying these devices is crucial for understanding the network's structure and identifying potential entry points for exploitation.

**Techniques for Identifying VoIP Devices**:
VoIP devices often communicate over specific ports, such as SIP (port 5060), RTP, and others. Utilizing port scanning tools like Nmap allows the identification of these open ports. Following initial discovery, protocol-specific probes can be used to verify the existence of VoIP gateways and PBX servers. By leveraging these probes, one can gather initial fingerprints that suggest the presence of VoIP infrastructure components.

**Fingerprinting VoIP Gateways**:
Tools like SIPVicious and sngrep are indispensable for gathering detailed information about the gateways. These tools allow you to capture and analyze SIP traffic to identify attributes such as vendor specifics, configuration errors, and service banners. Example commands for using SIPVicious include:

```bash
svmap -v -d 1 target_ip
```
This command allows you to scan the target for SIP devices and obtain valuable details for further analysis.

**PBX Enumeration**:
The enumeration of PBX systems involves querying these systems to identify available extensions and features. By understanding the features enabled on systems like Asterisk or Avaya, operators can map out the capabilities and potential vulnerabilities in the PBX setup. This can involve manipulating configuration files, leveraging default credentials, and exploiting unsecured interfaces.

**SSL/TLS in VoIP Systems**:
Many VoIP systems implement encryption to protect communications. However, misconfigurations in SSL/TLS settings can provide an attacker with entry points. By analyzing SSL certificates and assessing the encryption protocols used, attackers can identify weak points that may allow them to intercept or manipulate VoIP traffic.

### Mapping VoIP Network Topology

After identifying the key VoIP components, mapping the network topology is essential for understanding the structure, as well as for planning attack vectors across the network.

**Network Segmentation Analysis**:
VoIP infrastructure is often segregated from other network traffic. By identifying and exploring these segments, attackers can understand how VoIP traffic is separated and routed. Techniques such as VLAN hopping and the use of SNMP queries can provide insights into how networks are divided and protected.

**Traffic Pattern Analysis**:
Analyzing traffic patterns involves capturing VoIP traffic—using tools like Wireshark—to study call flows, quality metrics, and IP route traversal. By analyzing packet captures, one can deduce not only the structure but also the operational dynamics of the VoIP network.

**VoIP Infrastructure Components**:
Mapping also involves identifying all components that form the VoIP infrastructure, including phones, gateways, switches, and routers. This understanding can be achieved through active scanning, SNMP enumeration, and service discovery techniques that help illustrate how communication flows between each component.

**VoIP Protocol Analysis**:
Comprehending the communication processes involves analyzing protocols such as SIP, H.323, and RTP. Protocol analysis allows attackers to build a detailed map of the network and identify any security flaws present in the way these protocols are implemented or secured.

By methodically exploring and mapping the infrastructure of a VoIP environment, cybersecurity professionals can pinpoint vulnerabilities within the architecture, providing a tactical advantage in ongoing assessments and offensive operations. Each subtopic offers a critical perspective in understanding the full scope of the VoIP network topology, ensuring a thorough and practical comprehension of the infrastructure at hand.
