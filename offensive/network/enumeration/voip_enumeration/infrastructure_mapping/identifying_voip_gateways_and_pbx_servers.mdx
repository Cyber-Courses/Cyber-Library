# Identifying VoIP Gateways and PBX Servers

## Network Scanning Techniques for VoIP Infrastructure

### Active Scanning with Nmap

Utilize Nmap to perform active scanning of the network to identify VoIP Gateways and PBX servers. Nmap offers a range of options specifically useful for discovering these types of devices, such as version detection and custom scripts. A typical scan might include options like `-sV` to enable version detection and `--script` to apply VoIP-specific scripts.

#### Advanced Nmap Scan Options for VoIP Discovery

To effectively detect VoIP infrastructure, it's imperative to target the protocols and ports commonly used by VoIP devices. Start with a comprehensive port scan using commands such as `nmap -p 5060,5061,1719,1720  -sV <target IP>` to check for standard SIP and H.323 ports.

Example Nmap Command:
```bash
nmap -p 5060,5061,1719,1720 -sV --script=voip-scan <target IP>
```

This will not only probe the standard ports for open and responsive services but also attempt to identify the application running behind each service with the help of integrated scripts tailored towards VoIP.

#### Usage of VoIP-Specific Nmap Scripts for Gateway and PBX Identification

Nmap includes NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) scripts focused on identifying VoIP components. For instance, the `sip-methods` script queries SIP servers to list allowed methods, which can reveal useful information about the underlying VoIP solution.

Example:
```bash
nmap --script=sip-methods -p 5060 <target IP>
```

This Nmap script specifically targets SIP endpoints to uncover the supported methods, aiding in the identification process by comparing the responses to known characteristics typical of certain VoIP system vendors.

### Utilizing Masscan for Rapid Port Scanning

Employ Masscan when rapid scanning is necessary, especially in large network environments. Masscan functions similarly to Nmap but is designed to scan the Internet more quickly, providing a quick overview of open service ports commonly used by VoIP systems.

#### Configuring Masscan for Scanning VoIP-Specific Ports

Masscan can be tuned to focus explicitly on VoIP-related ports, decreasing the overall scan time. For instance:

Example Masscan Command:
```bash
masscan <network range> -pU:5060-5061,T:1719-1720 --rate 1000
```

This command instructs Masscan to scan the common UDP and TCP ports for SIP and H.323, with a modifiable rate of requests per second, effectively zeroing in on potential VoIP infrastructure components.

#### Interpreting Masscan Output for VoIP Asset Discovery

Once you obtain results, filter for familiar port numbers (e.g., 5060 for SIP) to identify potential VoIP devices quickly. Consider correlating these outputs with vendor-specific responses obtained from more refined probing tools like Nmap to confirm the identification.

## Fingerprinting VoIP Devices

### Fingerprinting with SIPVicious

SIPVicious is a popular suite used for VoIP reconnaissance, notable for its ability to fingerprint SIP devices leveraging different utility scripts.

#### Implementing svmap for SIP Endpoint Identification

The `svmap` tool within SIPVicious is used to identify live SIP devices on the network, offering a simple way to discover SIP servers and VoIP gateways.

Example Usage:
```bash
svmap -u <network>
```

This approach sends SIP OPTIONS requests across the network, facilitating the detection of devices that respond to SIP transactions.

#### Detecting PBX and VoIP Gateways with svwar and svcrack

Tools like `svwar` and `svcrack` in the SIPVicious suite aid in enumerating users and cracking SIP passwords respectively, leveraging typical misconfigurations or default settings in VoIP gateways and PBX servers.

Example svwar Command:
```bash
svwar -m INVITE -u 1000-2000 <target IP>
```

By sending INVITE requests, `svwar` attempts to discover valid SIP usernames, while `svcrack` can then be used to attempt gaining unauthorized access by brute-forcing known users with weak credentials.

### Using Metasploit Modules for VoIP Fingerprinting

Metasploit includes various modules tailored for VoIP device discovery and exploitation, allowing offensive security practitioners to identify and fingerprint VoIP devices.

#### Employing Metasploit's Probes for Accurate VoIP Device Detection

Modules such as `sip_invite` send INVITE requests to get responses that can effectively reveal the device types and configurations.

Example Metasploit Usage:
```ruby
use auxiliary/scanner/sip/sip_invite
set RHOSTS <target IP>
run
```

This script sends SIP INVITE requests across the supplied target range and analyzes the responses to provide detailed device fingerprinting results.

#### Automation of VoIP Fingerprinting with Custom Metasploit Scripts

Craft custom scripts within Metasploit or modify existing auxiliary modules to automate common fingerprinting tasks over extended network ranges, enabling efficient and detailed discovery of VoIP devices.

## Validation and Enumeration of SIP Services

### SIP Enumeration Practices

Conducting SIP enumeration helps in mapping the extent of VoIP infrastructure while identifying vulnerable points that might exist due to poor configurations.

#### Techniques for SIP Username and Extensions Enumeration

Identify extensions and usernames using tools like `sipcli` or `SIPVicious` which probe the target with a sequence of entries and listen for valid responses.

Example sipcli Command:
```bash
sipcli -v -u 1000-2000 -d 1 -s <target SIP server>
```

By sequentially trying extension numbers, one can find valid endpoints in use on the network, thus making it possible to enumerate the services provided.

### Asterisk PBX Enumeration and Validation

Uncovering details of an Asterisk PBX system can highlight misconfigurations, default settings, or exposed interfaces that need securing.

#### Methods for Enumerating Asterisk Systems

Utilize tools that send customized SIP requests to enumerate devices knowingly running Asterisk, which might respond with distinct headers or version information.

Example Asterisk Enumeration:
```bash
sipvicious_svmap -u <target IP> --user-agent 'Asterisk PBX'
```

Inspect responses for known version banners or responses that betray default configurations, leveraging common knowledge of Asterisk setups to predict defaults.

#### Identifying Default and Misconfigured Asterisk Installations

Investigations should hone in on PBX setups often left at default configurations post-deploymentâ€”such scenarios are ripe for exploitation if not adequately re-secured.

Examine the PBX for default admin paths or easily guessable credentials that could be remaining from the installation process, allowing for basic unauthorized entry points.

## Analyzing Network Traffic for VoIP Indicators

### Traffic Capture with Wireshark and TShark

Utilize packet analysis to detect and analyze VoIP traffic, using Wireshark's filtering capabilities to isolate relevant data points.

#### Filtering SIP Traffic to Detect VoIP Gateways and Servers

Create sophisticated filters for SIP and RTP traffic to pinpoint activity patterns or anomalies which could indicate the presence of underlying VoIP infrastructure.

Example Wireshark Filter:
```
sip || rtp
```

Identify elements within these protocols that might betray the existence of gateways or PBX systems, noticing typical signaling channels or media streams indicative of voice traffic.

#### Identifying Audio Streams and Dynamic RTP Port Assignments

Track RTP streams using dynamic port allocation insights, analyzing their transitions to expose the topological and operational attributes of VoIP systems.

### Utilizing Bro/Zeek for VoIP Traffic Analysis

Capitalize on the power of Bro/Zeek for wider scope real-time traffic surveillance and logging to continuously monitor VoIP protocol engagements.

#### Configuring Zeek to Monitor for VoIP Protocols and Indicators

Set up Zeek to focus on protocols like SIP and sessions that could flag potential VoIP gateway activities or PBX interaction.

Zeek Scripting Example:
```zeek
@load protocols/sip
redef SIP::session_timeout = 300 secs;
```

Such configurations increase the visibility and alert capabilities for ongoing VoIP communications within the network realm.

#### Analyzing VoIP Call Data Records for Infrastructure Mapping

Explore Call Data Records (CDRs) found within network traffic to chart out the dynamic interactions facilitated by PBX systems or external gateways hosting these records.

## Exploiting Network Protocol Weaknesses

### SIP Protocol Weaknesses

Recognize the vulnerabilities within the SIP protocol that can be manipulated for unauthorized advantage or access.

#### Techniques for Forced SIP Registration and Flooding

Implement registration hijacks or rogue device flooding techniques to break the service continuity or compromise unprotected endpoints.

Example Registration Attack:
```bash
sipvicious_svcrack  <target IP>
```

Simulate a denied service state or force resource exhaustion states on unprepared services to assess their real-world resilience levels.

### H.323 and Other VoIP Protocol Vulnerabilities

Identify and exploit protocol-specific weaknesses found in non-SIP VoIP operations to ensure full coverage across varied gateway implementations.

#### Identifying and Exploiting H.323 Protocol Weaknesses

Use understanding of network defects in H.323-managed deployments to launch effective routing or hijacking attacks on call sessions.

Monitor H.323 signaling paths for possible interjection exploits that can be executed with tailored-manipulated request injections.

#### Adopting Custom Scripts for Proprietary VoIP Protocols

Develop scripts catering explicitly to less-known or proprietary VoIP protocol exposures, creating a thorough penetration landscape view.

## Leveraging Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) for VoIP

### Gathering Publicly Accessible VoIP Information

Fuse actively gathered data with OSINT avenues by employing search aggregators to corral VoIP asset information.

#### Utilizing Shodan and Other Search Engines for VoIP Assets

Use Shodan, Censys, and similar platforms to identify publicly exposed VoIP devices based on characteristic signature scans.

Example Shodan Query:
```
port:5060 "User-Agent"
```

Combine searchable exposure with specifics from past scan results to consolidate knowledge about the VoIP environments being assessed.

#### Cross-referencing OSINT with Enumeration Findings for Verification

Correlate open source data with physical or scan-driven data points to triangulate conclusions about the existence and health of targeted VoIP gatekeepers.

This cross-referencing ensures a more holistic outlook on the security posture presented by an organization's VoIP architecture, accounting for oversights apparent in its deployment and maintenance lifecycles.
