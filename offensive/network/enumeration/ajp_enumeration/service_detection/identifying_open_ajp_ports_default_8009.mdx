# Identifying Open AJP Ports (Default 8009)

In offensive cybersecurity, identifying open Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) ports is a crucial step in network reconnaissance. AJP is used primarily to facilitate communication between web servers like Apache and application servers such as Tomcat. Recognizing open ports can assist attackers in understanding network configurations and exploiting potential vulnerabilities. This section delves into techniques and tools used to detect open AJP ports, which by default are configured to listen on port 8009.

### Introduction to AJP Enumeration Techniques

AJP enumeration forms a critical component of network reconnaissance, a practice used to gather information about target systems. It involves identifying network services, configurations, and potential vulnerabilities. The ability to detect open AJP ports allows an attacker to potentially interface with backend services directly, bypassing web application controls. Practitioners start by probing for the default port 8009, but should also be aware that services might be configured on non-standard ports.

### Utilization of Network Scanning Tools

Network scanning tools are foundational in identifying open AJP ports. Here we discuss how some of the most popular tools can be utilized for this purpose:

- **nmap**: An immensely popular and versatile network scanning tool, nmap can be used to search for open AJP ports with specific scripts. The command below checks for open port 8009 on a target network:

  ```
  nmap -p 8009 --script ajp-auth <target>
  ```
  
  The `ajp-auth` script helps verify if the port is hosting an AJP service, providing authentication information if accessible.

- **masscan**: Known for its speed, masscan is capable of scanning an immense number of IPs quickly to determine if port 8009 is open:

  ```
  masscan -p8009 <target_range> --rate=<number>
  ```
  
  This command probes port 8009 across a specified IP range. Adjust the rate parameter based on network bandwidth and scanning speed requirements.

- **zmap**: Another high-speed scanner, zmap is tailored for internet-wide surveys but is equally capable in a controlled environment:

  ```
  zmap -p 8009 <target_range> -o results.csv
  ```
  
  This command scans the target range for open port 8009 and logs the results to a CSV file for further analysis.

### Analyzing Firewall and ACL Configurations

Firewalls and Access Control Lists (ACLs) are intended to filter unwanted traffic, potentially obfuscating open ports such as AJP. When performing reconnaissance, it's important to understand how these configurations can impact scan results:

- **Firewall bypass:** Port knocking or turning to alternate routing techniques might be necessary to bypass well-configured firewalls.
  
- **ACL inspection:** Determine if network ACLs might be allowing or blocking traffic based on known conditions, requiring deeper analysis or adjustment in scanning strategies.

### Crafting Custom Scanners

For environments where traditional scanning tools might be insufficient or easily detected, crafting custom scripts can be effective. A basic Python script utilizing socket programming allows for custom AJP port checks:

```python
import socket

def check_ajp_port(host, port=8009):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.settimeout(1)
    try:
        sock.connect((host, port))
        print(f"AJP Port 8009 is open on {host}")
    except socket.error:
        print(f"AJP Port 8009 is closed or filtered on {host}")
    sock.close()

check_ajp_port('192.168.1.10')
```

This script attempts to establish a socket connection to the specified host and port, checking if the port is accessible.

### Verification of Open AJP Ports

Once potential open ports are identified, verification is required to confirm the presence of an active AJP service:

- **Service Banner Grabbing**: An initial connection to the port might reveal a service banner, providing version and configuration details.
  
- **Packet Inspection**: Analyze returned packets using tools like Wireshark to verify AJP protocol transactions.

### Handling False Positives

False positives in AJP detection can occur due to misinterpretations of network responses:

- **Response Analysis**: Detailed examination of AJP responses can determine if a service is genuinely AJP or another protocol mimicking its behavior.
  
- **Response Time and Error Codes**: Compare response times and error messages typical of AJP services to filter out irrelevant results.

### Continuous Port Monitoring

Implementing solutions to continuously monitor critical networks for newly opened AJP ports can be crucial:

- **Automated Scanning**: Set up scheduled nmap or custom scripts that periodically re-scan the network and trigger alerts to changes in port status.

- **Network Monitoring Integration**: Leverage SIEM systems to correlate scan findings with network logs for comprehensive monitoring and alerting. These systems not only indicate exposure but also help in incident response planning.

Through these methodologies, security practitioners can methodically identify, verify, and monitor open AJP ports, maintaining an effective offensive security posture.
