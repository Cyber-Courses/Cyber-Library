# Mapping Visualization Configurations

## Understanding Kibana Visualizations

Kibana is a powerful data visualization tool often used in conjunction with Elasticsearch to explore and display complex datasets. At its core, Kibana offers various visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, pie charts, and more, each designed to make data analysis intuitive and insightful. These visualizations are built on user-defined indices within Elasticsearch, enabling users to correlate data trends, patterns, and anomalies.

In an offensive cybersecurity context, understanding these visualizations is pivotal. Attackers can leverage insights garnered from visualizations to enumerate and map an organization’s data landscape effectively. This knowledge aids in identifying critical assets, understanding data flow, and recognizing potential entry points for exploits.

## Accessing Visualization Configuration Settings

To explore visualization configurations in Kibana, one must first navigate the Kibana user interface to locate and access the relevant settings. These are typically found under the "Visualize" or "Dashboard" sections of the Kibana menu. Armed with proper credentials, an attacker can manipulate powerful search and filter functionalities to pinpoint specific visualizations tied to sensitive data fields or indices.

Accessing these configurations involves clicking on a visualization to open the editor panel, where settings such as data source, metrics, axes, and filters can be adjusted. Each component of the visualization has specific configuration options that dictate how data is queried and displayed, offering a comprehensive view of data relationships.

## Deciphering Visualization Schemes

Visualizations in Kibana are underpinned by data schemas that define the structure and organization of datasets. These schemas, often visualized through the Kibana interface, illustrate the mapping of data fields, including types, formats, and hierarchical relationships. Understanding the visualization schemes allows attackers to identify how data is interrelated, extrapolating insights on data groupings, and pinpointing valuable datasets for extraction.

These schemes also reveal visualization parameters, such as data splits, aggregations, and time spans, which are crucial for constructing detailed data viewpoints and identifying information processing workflows within an organization’s network infrastructure.

## Modifying Visualization Parameters

Once familiar with the visualization schemes, attackers can adjust configuration parameters to alter how data is displayed. This process involves modifying settings like data aggregation levels, metric computations, and applying custom filters. Such modifications can reveal hidden data structures or isolate specific data subsets for detailed enumeration.

For example, adjusting the time window filter could expose data patterns over particular periods, aiding in the analysis of network activity during suspected breaches or data exfiltration events.

## Man-in-the-Middle Visualization Manipulation

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks on visualization configurations involve intercepting and modifying data exchanges between the Kibana interface and its backend services. Attackers can leverage MitM tools like Burp Suite or Wireshark to capture configuration data packets and inject altered values, manipulating how data is visualized.

This manipulation could allow attackers to create false data patterns or hide evidence of their intrusion activities within the visualized data, complicating detection and forensics efforts by network defenders.

## Exporting Visualization Configurations

Kibana facilitates exporting visualization configurations through its built-in tools, allowing users—and potentially attackers— to download visualization settings as JSON or other formats for analysis and replication. These exports contain comprehensive configuration details like queries, data sources, and visualization parameters.

Analyzing exported configurations enables attackers to identify manipulation or insertion points, providing opportunities to implement backdoor settings or to replicate visualizations in separate environments for further tactical analysis.

## Scripted Manipulation of Configurations

For more efficient manipulation, attackers can write scripts that automate the extraction, editing, and reinsertion of visualization configurations. Leveraging Kibana APIs, such scripts can directly interact with Kibana’s backend to alter visualization settings on a large scale, bypassing manual editing processes.

Example scripts written in Python or JavaScript can automate these interactions, updating configuration parameters dynamically in response to ongoing enumeration findings.

```python
import requests

url = "http://kibana-server/api/saved_objects/visualization/id"
headers = {
    'kbn-xsrf': 'true',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
data = {
    "attributes": {
        "title": "Modified Visualization"
        # Additional configuration settings
    }
}

response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

## Persistence Techniques in Visualization Configurations

To ensure lasting control over visualization settings, attackers can employ persistence techniques that cement changes, even after network reboot or intrusion cleanup initiatives. This could involve embedding scripts or altering permissions associated with configuration files to resist easy cleanup.

Techniques might include setting cron jobs for automatic configuration reapplication or embedding hidden scripts that reinstate manipulated settings upon detection of unauthorized adjustments.

## Detection Evasion Tactics Using Visualizations

To mitigate the risk of detection during visualization manipulation, attackers often employ evasion tactics. This includes blending altered configurations with legitimate data patterns, making it challenging for network defenders to discern authentic visualization settings from compromised ones.

Obfuscation strategies could involve renaming altered visualizations, diversifying manipulated data points among numerous visualizations, or leveraging Kibana’s space isolation feature to segregate manipulated configurations from routine monitoring.
