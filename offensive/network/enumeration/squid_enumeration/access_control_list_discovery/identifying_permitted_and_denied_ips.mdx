# Identifying Permitted and Denied IPs in Access Control List Discovery

## Understanding IP Filtering Mechanisms

To effectively identify permitted and denied IPs within a network, one must first understand the mechanisms behind IP filtering. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a primary method for controlling traffic based on IP addresses. They define explicit rules set either to permit (allow) or deny (block) specific IP addresses or ranges. Typically, ACLs are implemented in network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, where they apply filtering to incoming and outgoing traffic according to predefined security rules.

The identification process starts with analyzing traffic patterns to determine where filtering occurs. Tools like Wireshark can capture and inspect network packets, revealing differences in how permitted and denied traffic is handled. Understanding what access control methods are in use will guide subsequent enumeration efforts and allow for more targeted analysis techniques.

## Network Scanning Techniques

Network scanning is a fundamental means of enumerating IP-based ACL rules. Tools such as Nmap can probe network devices to assess which IPs are permitted or denied. By conducting systematic scans across network segments, one can identify active hosts and open ports, helping infer policies based on observed accessibility or the lack thereof. Additionally, by comparing the results of scans conducted at different times or from different locations, patterns may emerge that indicate ACL-enforced restrictions.

Example Command:
```bash
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
```

This command discovers active hosts in the specified subnet, revealing which IPs respond and thus may be permitted by ACL rules.

## Probing with Crafted Packets

Probing with crafted packets involves creating and sending network packets with specific characteristics to test how the network responds. This technique allows for detailed exploration of ACL behavior and can identify precisely which IPs are allowed or denied. Tools like Scapy enable the creation of custom packet sequences to simulate different network conditions. By analyzing the responses—or lack thereof—researchers can deduce the rules governing IP filtering.

Example Command:
```python
from scapy.all import *
packet = IP(dst="192.168.1.1")/ICMP()
send(packet)
```

This script sends an ICMP packet to a target IP, allowing analysts to observe whether the packet is acknowledged or filtered by ACLs.

## Leveraging DNS Interactions

DNS interactions can offer indirect clues about ACL configurations. By performing DNS enumeration and monitoring how DNS queries are handled, it is possible to infer allowed IPs. For instance, DNS servers might respond differently based on the origin of a query; inconsistencies in resolution can suggest underlying ACL rules that permit or deny specific IP addresses. This approach complements direct network scanning by providing another layer of insight.

Example Command:
```bash
dig @dns-server-ip targetdomain.com
```

This command queries the DNS server and examines the response to identify possible IP filtering through DNS resolution patterns.

## Proxy and Gateway Evaluation

Network proxies and gateways often enforce IP-based access control, making them critical points for investigation. By attempting to connect through these nodes, it becomes possible to deduce which IP ranges are subject to ACL enforcement. Analyzing proxy logs (if accessible) can also provide a direct view of how filtering rules are applied. Moreover, testing proxy and gateway configurations with various IPs helps map out permitted paths through the network.

Example Command:
```bash
curl -x http://proxy-server-ip:port http://target-url
```

This curl command uses a proxy server to access a target URL, testing the proxy's permission configuration regarding specific IPs.

## Automated Script Utilization

Automation accelerates the discovery process, reducing manual effort and increasing accuracy. Scripts can be devised to iterate over IP ranges, testing each for permission or denial by ACLs. This approach allows for continuous, large-scale enumeration, logging results for subsequent analysis. Scripts are particularly effective in networks with complex or extensive rule sets that necessitate exhaustive testing.

Example Script (Python):
```python
import socket
for ip in range(1, 255):
    try:
        sock = socket.create_connection((f"192.168.1.{ip}", 80), timeout=2)
        print(f"192.168.1.{ip} is permitted")
    except:
        print(f"192.168.1.{ip} is denied")
```

## Exploiting Weak ACL Configurations

Identifying and exploiting weak ACL configurations involves testing for common misconfigurations that may allow unauthorized access or inadvertently block legitimate traffic. For instance, unfiltered wildcard entries or improperly prioritized rules can expose network vulnerabilities. Techniques such as IP spoofing, which involves forging the source IP address, can be employed to bypass simplistic ACL checks.

Example Command:
```bash
hping3 -S -p 80 --spoof 192.168.1.100 target-ip
```

This command performs a SYN scan using a spoofed IP address to test for vulnerabilities in ACL enforcement.

## Analyzing Response Codes

HTTP response codes from web servers provide indirect indicators of permitted IPs. Successful responses (e.g., HTTP 200) often imply a permitted IP, while errors (e.g., HTTP 403 Forbidden) suggest denial. Logging these responses during access attempts enables the fine-tuning of assumptions about ACL configurations.

Example Command:
```bash
curl -I http://target-server --interface interface-ip
```

Analyzing the HTTP headers returned from this command helps determine if the current IP is permitted by ACLs.

## Network Block Testing

Network block testing involves systematically testing ranges (or blocks) of IP addresses to delineate permitted and denied zones. This helps identify the breadth of ACL application across entire network segments using methodologies akin to binary search, thus minimizing the number of necessary probes.

Example Process:
1. Conduct a scan of the entire network block.
2. Perform a series of targeted tests to quickly reveal block boundaries.
3. Narrow tests to identify specific IPs within discovered blocks.

## Avoidance and Evasion Tactics

IP avoidance and evasion techniques can subvert ACL restrictions, allowing penetration testers to navigate constrained environments. Methods like IP spoofing and traffic obfuscation exploit weaknesses or gaps in ACL logic, providing insights into what traffic is allowed through circumvention tactics.

Example Command:
```bash
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

This command enables IP masquerading, an evasion technique to hide the source IP from restrictive ACLs.

## Consolidation and Reporting

After extensive testing and gathering data, compile findings into detailed reports. These documents should catalogue the identified permitted and denied IPs, outline ACL rules inferred from tests, and highlight potential exploits or weaknesses discovered. Such reports are valuable for developing strategies for both offensive and defensive measures, providing insights on network security posture and mitigation planning. Use structured reporting formats like spreadsheets or knowledge bases to enhance clarity and accessibility.
