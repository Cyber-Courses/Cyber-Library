### Analyzing Permissions on SFTP Shares

#### Overview of Analyzing Permissions on SFTP Shares

Analyzing permissions on SFTP shares is an essential aspect of assessing security postures. Misconfigurations in permission settings can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or potential avenues for further exploitation. Understanding the permissions can help identify vulnerabilities and ensure that sensitive data remains secured from unauthorized access, and allows for configuring SFTP server settings to minimize potential risk exposure effectively.

#### Permissions Models on SFTP

##### UNIX Permission Model

The UNIX permission model, intrinsic to many SFTP implementations, is based on three distinct classes of permissions: user (owner), group, and others. Each of these classes can have read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) permissions applied to files and directories. For example, a permission setting of `rwxr-x---` indicates full access for the file owner, read and execute access for the group, and no permissions for others. Understanding this basic model is crucial, as excessive permissions (e.g., `777`) can lead to exploitation capabilities such as deletion, alteration, and unauthorized access by external users.

##### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Some SFTP systems may utilize Role-Based Access Control to enforce permissions. RBAC involves assigning access permissions based on the roles assigned to a user rather than individual settings. Roles are predefined with specific permissions that meet the least privilege principle necessary for users to perform their jobs. Recognizing and analyzing the roles configured can help identify misplaced privileges or over-permissioned roles, which can be levered during cyber attacks.

##### Advanced Permissions

Extended file attributes and Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide more granularity in permissions management beyond traditional Unix models. ACLs allow specifying permissions for an arbitrary number of people or groups, as well as more fine-tuned permission types, which can sometimes lead to complex permission structures that are difficult to manage and audit. Understanding their implementation will help in determining every explicit permission each user has, which is critical in uncovering misconfigurations.

#### Permission Enumeration Techniques

##### Manual Inspection Techniques

SFTP clients, like FileZilla or WinSCP, can manually inspect permissions by navigating through directories and checking permissions associated with each file. Access permissions are usually displayed alongside other metadata, making them straightforward to analyze for experienced users. This manual audit can identify misconfigurations that scripts might overlook due to their static nature.

##### Automated Tools and Scripts

Numerous tools and custom scripts are available to automate the enumeration of SFTP permissions comprehensively. Tools like `sftp-perm-audit` can scan directories systematically, outputting findings related to potential vulnerabilities in permission configurations. Custom scripts can be written utilizing libraries such as `paramiko` for Python, allowing more customizable scanning targets based on specific criteria of interest.

Example script snippet using `paramiko` for permission enumeration:
```python
import paramiko

def list_sftp_permissions(username, password, hostname):
    ssh_client = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    ssh_client.connect(hostname, username=username, password=password)
    
    sftp_client = ssh_client.open_sftp()
    items = sftp_client.listdir_attr('/')

    for item in items:
        print(f"{item.filename}: {oct(item.st_mode)[-3:]}")

    sftp_client.close()
    ssh_client.close()

list_sftp_permissions("user", "pass", "sftp.example.com")
```

#### Identifying Vulnerable Permissions

##### World-Writable Directories and Files

Files or directories with world-writable permissions (`777` or similarly insecure settings) are inherently risky, as any user can alter them. During penetration testing, these can be exploited to place scripts, backdoors, or additional temporary data that other, more privileged processes might unknowingly execute.

##### Sensitive File Exposures

Sensitive files with overly permissive settings can lead to data breaches. Files intended only for specific internal users (e.g., configuration files with plain text passwords) should not be accessible by all users. Analysts must check exposure risks, especially in directories such as `/var` or `/etc`, common on Linux-like systems.

##### Discovering Misowned Files

Files and directories should generally be owned by the specific users or service accounts responsible for them. Files improperly owned by default accounts or accounts with unnecessary privileges pose a security risk and can become useful to attackers for privilege escalation.

---

#### Exploiting Misconfigurations

##### Leveraging Write Permissions

Exploiting writable directories allows attackers to insert rogue scripts or overwrite legitimate files. Writable public directories (e.g., `/tmp`) are frequent targets since writing malicious content which a privileged user or service might subsequently execute is an attack vector.

##### Permission Race Conditions

Race conditions in permission settings arise when changes are incomplete or applied inconsistently across environments. Attackers may exploit these to modify or seize control of a file momentarily during the transition between permission states, leading to unauthorized operations.

##### Bypassing Permission Configurations

Incorrectly configured ACLs can provide limited access that intelligent exploitation may bypass. Methods of bypassing improperly supervised user lists or recovering unsecured shadow permission settings can allow attackers to circumvent regular permissions checks.

---

#### Persistence Mechanisms Through Permissions

##### Maintaining Access via Permission Manipulation

Privilege manipulation through permissions is a well-known persistence tactic. By modifying or misconfiguring files to remain perpetually writable or executable by non-administrative accounts, attackers maintain access, execute planted backdoors, or potentially reintroduce vulnerabilities post-cleaning.

##### Integrity Checking and Monitoring Bypass

To remain undetected, attackers strive to bypass integrity monitoring and checks. Certain SFTP environments use integrity monitoring tools to verify permissions settings and attribute changes. Attackers utilize knowledge of these systems to develop undetectable pathways of access or perpetually revert matured configurations to previous, vulnerable states through automated scripts.

#### Tools and Techniques for Effective Permission Audits

##### Comprehensive Audit Tools

Audit tools like `Lynis` or `Auditd` provide comprehensive solutions for logging and analyzing permission settings. These tools can generate detailed reports highlighting discrepancies in expected versus configured permissions, anomalies suggesting human error, and signatures that correlate with known exploits.

##### Custom Scripting for Permission Analysis

Developing custom scripts using languages familiar with network operations (like Python and Bash) allows real-time dynamic enumeration. These scripts can be executed on-demand or through cron jobs to provide continuous feedback and proactively detect anomalies outside of regular audit cycles.

##### Integration with Continuous Monitoring Solutions

Infrastructures using continuous monitoring solutions often incorporate SFTP shares. Successfully integrating permissions analysis into these solutions allows for automated alerts and reports on deviations from desired security baselines, improving the security posture by enforcing a consistent least-privilege configuration across environments.
