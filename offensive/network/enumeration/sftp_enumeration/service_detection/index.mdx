# SFTP Enumeration: Service Detection

## Identifying SFTP Services on Port 22

### Network Scanning Techniques

Service detection on port 22, commonly used by SSH, involves using network scanning tools to discover active SFTP services. Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, is frequently employed for this purpose. The basic command for initiating a scan on a specified IP range might look like `nmap -p 22 [target IP range]`. This command initiates a scan targeting port 22 across the specified network range, reporting open ports and potential services.

Advanced options such as `-sV` enable service version detection, offering insights into the software versions running on detected services. This command, `nmap -sV -p 22 [target]`, attempts to determine the exact version of the software behind an open port, providing additional context necessary for identifying SFTP capabilities embedded within SSH services.

### Fingerprinting SSH Services

Given that SFTP services typically coexist with SSH on port 22, accurately fingerprinting the SSH service is essential. This process involves analyzing SSH handshakes, particularly the initial exchange messages like SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT, which can help infer whether the SFTP subsystem is enabled. Tools like `ssh-audit` allow for in-depth analysis of various SSH handshake responses to deduce features and security levels present in the SSH service.

By examining these handshake messages, one can differentiate SFTP-supporting servers from those offering only basic SSH functionalities. This differentiation often requires examining the software signatures and protocol versions reported during the handshake process to look for indicators of SFTP capabilities.

### Leveraging Service Enumeration Scripts

For detailed service and protocol inspection, Nmap's scripting engine (NSE) provides a variety of scripts tailored for SSH/SFTP enumeration, such as `ssh2-enum-algos` and `ssh-hostkey`. The command `nmap --script ssh2-enum-algos -p 22 [target]` runs a script that attempts to enumerate the supported encryption and algorithm suites of the SSH service, which can hint at SFTP configurations.

Using these scripts can help determine the presence of an SFTP subsystem by highlighting specific algorithms and configurations typically associated with SFTP services. The results from these scripts, especially when used together, offer comprehensive insights into whether the SSH service on port 22 also includes SFTP functionalities.

## Analyzing SSH Banners for SFTP Capabilities

### Banner Grabbing Techniques

Banner grabbing involves capturing the welcome message from an SSH server during the initial connection phase. This banner can reveal software versions and configurations. Tools like `telnet` or `nc` (Netcat) can be used to connect to port 22 and record the server's banner. A typical command might be `nc -v -n [target] 22`, where the verbose flag helps identify connectivity and materialize the server banner.

Banners often contain hints about the SSH server's version and associated features like SFTP. If the SFTP subsystem is enabled, it might be listed explicitly in the banner or deduced from the associated protocol version and server type.

### Analyzing SFTP Subsystem Advertisements

Once the banner is acquired, further analysis involves interpreting the subsystem advertisements within the SSH banner. This may require comparing the information to known subsystem strings that indicate SFTP support, such as identifying the inclusion of SFTP in known server versions of specific software like OpenSSH.

Automated scripts and tools can parse these banners, looking for specifics that correlate with SFTP capabilities, thus enabling detection without continuous manual intervention. This step ensures consistent monitoring and detection of banner-based revelations over time.

### Exploiting Banner Misconfigurations

Misconfigurations or excess information within SSH banners can expose vulnerabilities or unnecessary details. Insecure banners might report excessive detail about the running software versions or even developmental states, which attackers can use to target version-specific exploits.

By narrowing down vulnerabilities associated with the detected versions, attackers can craft or customize exploits to compromise the SFTP services. Common vulnerabilities tied to specific SSH versions, once detected, provide a roadmap for penetration testing and system hardening efforts. 

Automating this detection process reduces the window where vulnerabilities potentially exposed by verbose banners remain exploitable, emphasizing the importance of accurate banner configuration and regular security assessments.
