### Enumerating Tables and Columns

#### Understanding SQL Injection for Table Enumeration

SQL Injection serves as a primary method for attackers seeking to enumerate tables within a database. Identifying SQL injection vulnerabilities requires targeting user input fields that interact with SQL queries. Injection points can be identified through various techniques, including manual testing and automated scanners that detect weak input validations. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers can craft SQL queries that manipulate existing operations to expose metadata about database structures. 

Using SQL injection for metadata extraction involves leveraging UNION-based injections or crafted subqueries to append queries that target database metadata tables, such as `information_schema` in HSQLDB. Automation tools like SQLMap can simplify this process, enabling attackers to script complex queries and automate the information extraction process.

#### Table Enumeration via Information Schema

Accessing the information schema is a standard method for enumerating tables. SQL-based databases, including HSQLDB, store metadata in special system schemas like `information_schema`. Attackers query the `information_schema.tables` table to retrieve a list of all accessible tables within a database. A typical SQL injection query to enumerate tables might include:

```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

This query will retrieve table names from the public schema, which can then be filtered based on naming conventions or known target-specific tables. Such detailed enumeration aids in identifying which tables hold sensitive information or further attack vectors.

#### Column Enumeration from Metadata

Once tables are enumerated, enumerating columns is essential to understanding data structures. Attackers query the `information_schema.columns` to gather detailed attributes of each column, such as column name, data type, and constraints. A detailed column enumeration might look like this:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users';
```

Such retrievals allow attackers to understand the data types and potential content, informing further attacks like crafting specific injections to manipulate or extract data based on column characteristics.

#### Blind SQL Injection for Enumeration

Blind SQL Injection techniques are used when visible errors or results from injections are unavailable. Enumeration via blind SQL Injection requires iterative queries that infer data one bit at a time. Attackers leverage time-based or boolean-based methods where true/false logic is applied, often using automated tools to streamline these lengthy processes.

Time-based methods, for example, might use a query that conditionally causes a delay if a particular character matches:

```sql
SELECT IF(SUBSTRING((SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1), 1, 1) = 'm', SLEEP(5), 0);
```

This would conditionally pause the execution if the first character matches 'm', indicating success for partial enumeration progress.

#### Error-Based SQL Injection for Enumeration

Error-Based SQL Injection exploits database error messages to extract information. Crafting payloads that trigger descriptive error responses provide clues about database structure. For instance, incorrect column notice messages can reveal information inadvertently, such as available columns, through crafted queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM InvalidColumnName-Exception;
```

Automated tools can be configured to systematically produce errors, capturing the responses for analysis to assist in enumeration activities.

#### Leveraging ORMs for Table and Column Insights

ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) abstract database interaction, potentially simplifying enumeration tasks. Attackers exploiting ORMs focus on revealing database mappings that the ORM uses, often containing embedded SQL queries or stored procedure calls. Identifying ORM mappings and reverse-engineering these interactions allow attackers to indirectly determine table and column layouts.

#### Advanced Enumeration Techniques

In complex environments, attackers employ advanced SQL constructs like subqueries to facilitate enumeration, particularly where direct access is restricted. Handling encrypted or obfuscated database tables necessitates using decryption routines along with enumeration scripts.

Cross-database enumeration can involve leveraging knowledge of databases' differences, such as proprietary features in SQL Server or PostgreSQL that affect enumeration strategies.

#### Evasion Techniques in Enumeration

Enumeration can trigger alerts in sophisticated intrusion detection systems; thus, attackers employ evasion strategies. This can include obfuscating SQL payloads, using encoded queries that remain functional but difficult to match against attack signatures, or leveraging time-delay tactics to perform stealthy enumeration processes over extended periods.

Bypassing database security measures involves using well-crafted, low volume queries that provide results with minimal interaction, evading rate limits or query analysis algorithms. Techniques such as SQL query padding, no-operation (NOP) insertions, and clever use of built-in database functions can effectively reduce the risk of enumeration detection.
