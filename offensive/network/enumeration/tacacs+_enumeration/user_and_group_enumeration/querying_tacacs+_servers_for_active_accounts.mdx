# Querying TACACS+ Servers for Active Accounts

## Introduction to TACACS+ Protocol Overview

TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus) is a protocol developed by Cisco that provides access control for routers, network access servers, and other networked computing devices. Essential to network security, TACACS+ offers AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) services. Unlike RADIUS, TACACS+ separates these three processes, allowing for more flexibility and security in managing user permissions and auditing access.

TACACS+ operates over TCP (typically on port 49), ensuring reliable delivery of packets, which differentiates it from the UDP-based RADIUS. Furthermore, TACACS+ provides encrypting for the entire packet, aside from the header, which ensures that sensitive information, such as user credentials, is well-protected during transmission.

## Preparing for TACACS+ Enumeration

Preparation for enumerating TACACS+ servers involves understanding your target network's topology to identify potential TACACS+ servers. You need to access network device configurations, which might involve having appropriate permissions or leveraging vulnerabilities to obtain configurations that reference TACACS+ servers.

Familiarize yourself with tools and utilities designed for TACACS+ interactions, such as Cisco's IOS command-line interface or third-party applications like Wireshark, which can capture TACACS+ traffic for analysis. Ensure your toolkit includes utilities for network scanning, packet crafting, and analysis, such as Nmap and Scapy.

## Establishing Connectivity with TACACS+ Servers

Connectivity can be established using network probing and port scanning techniques to identify servers running TACACS+ services. Nmap can be utilized as follows to identify TACACS+ servers:

```bash
nmap -p 49 --open <target IP range>
```

Establishing a secure channel for interaction may involve the use of VPNs or other secure means to anonymize and protect your activities. Once connectivity is established, verify the active status of TACACS+ servers by analyzing load times and response characteristics after sending connection requests.

## Protocol Manipulation for User Data Extraction

The key to extracting user data from TACACS+ servers lies in crafting and sending appropriate TACACS+ requests. This involves understanding the TACACS+ protocol request format and using custom scripts or tools to send these requests and respond appropriately to prompts.

Analyze server responses to identify user enumeration opportunities. Look for consistent patterns or specific fields in the response that can provide insights into user accounts. This analysis can be done by capturing TACACS+ traffic through a tool like Wireshark and checking for user-related information.

## Active Account Identification Techniques

To distinguish active accounts from dormant ones, monitor traffic logs or server responses, looking for indications such as recent login timestamps or activity patterns. Leveraging TACACS+ access logs can provide historical login data to determine account activity.

Use captured log data to create a distinction framework that categorizes accounts based on last activity, regular login times, and interaction logs. Scripts can be developed for parsing logs and performing analysis efficiently.

## Advanced Query Techniques

Automating queries through scripting languages like Python can vastly improve efficiency and reduce the chance of detection. Libraries such as Scapy can be used to automate sending of crafted TACACS+ transactions, as shown in the following example:

```python
from scapy.all import *
# Example crafted packet (requires detailed knowledge of TACACS+ packet structure)
packet = IP(dst="target_IP")/TCP(dport=49)/Raw(load="your_custom_payload")
send(packet)
```

Manipulating queries to avoid detection entails using non-standard ports or staggered query timings to blend traffic within regular network activity, thereby diminishing the risk of triggering alerts within detection systems.

## Post-Enumeration Actions

Organize the collected data by documenting user identities, associated permissions, and recent activities. This data should be stored securely and formatted for further analysis. Cross-reference the enumerated data with other known identity stores within the organization, such as directory services (LDAP) or local authentication systems, to identify shared attributes or discrepancies.

## Countermeasure Awareness

Integrating countermeasure awareness into your processes is crucial. Understanding the logging and detection mechanisms employed on the target network allows for strategic evasion. Pay attention to network IDS/IPS configurations and log retention policies that might alert administrators to unusual TACACS+ activity.

Stay vigilant about the security mechanisms in place, such as rate-limiting rules or IP blacklisting that might disrupt or log your enumeration attempts. Anticipate countermeasures and implement preventive measures, such as using random IP sources or times for queries, to maintain stealth during operations.
