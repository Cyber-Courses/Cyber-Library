### Portmapper Enumeration

Portmapper Enumeration is a critical technique in the offensive cybersecurity domain, focusing on the discovery and analysis of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services. Understanding Portmapper and effectively enumerating it allows attackers to map a network, identify vulnerable services, and plan further exploits.

#### [Service Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/portmapper_enumeration/service_detection)

The discovery of Portmapper services is fundamental to identifying potential entry points within a network. Portmapper, traditionally running on port 111, is used to facilitate communication between clients and RPC services. Tools such as Nmap can be leveraged to detect these services. For instance, employing the Nmap command `nmap -sV -p 111 <target_ip>` can help identify open Portmapper services.

- **[Identifying Open Portmapper Services Port 111](offensive/network/enumeration/portmapper_enumeration/service_detection/identifying_open_portmapper_services_port_111/):** This involves scanning target networks specifically for open port 111, established by default for Portmapper service. Effective identification hinges on using port scanning tools to pinpoint systems that expose Portmapper, laying the groundwork for subsequent RPC service enumeration.

- **[Detecting RPC Program Numbers and Services](offensive/network/enumeration/portmapper_enumeration/service_detection/detecting_rpc_program_numbers_and_services/):** Once a Portmapper service is identified, the next step is to articulate which RPC programs are available. This involves leveraging utilities like `rpcinfo`, with commands such as `rpcinfo -p <target_ip>`, to retrieve a list of services, their program numbers, and versions.

#### [RPC Program Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/portmapper_enumeration/rpc_program_enumeration)

This encompasses the detailed enumeration of services registered with Portmapper, understanding the operational scope of each service, which is pivotal for both protective and offensive operations.

- **[Listing RPC Services via Portmapper](offensive/network/enumeration/portmapper_enumeration/rpc_program_enumeration/listing_rpc_services_via_portmapper/):** Enumerating listed services involves querying the Portmapper to list all registered RPC services. Each service’s unique identifier and relevant version information can be uncovered, aiding in threat analysis.

- **[Extracting RPC Program Details: Names, Versions](offensive/network/enumeration/portmapper_enumeration/rpc_program_enumeration/extracting_rpc_program_details_names_versions/):** A detailed enumeration of RPC programs entails identifying the names, associated port numbers, and versions of RPC services. Identifying outdated or uncommon versions can expose vulnerabilities suitable for exploitation.

#### [Network Mapping via RPC](offensive/network/enumeration/portmapper_enumeration/network_mapping_via_rpc)

Network Mapping through RPC services expands an attacker’s understanding of the network architecture. It enables the identification of critical services that may act as potential targets for exploitation.

- **[Identifying NFS and NIS Services](offensive/network/enumeration/portmapper_enumeration/network_mapping_via_rpc/identifying_nfs_and_nis_services/):** Analysis of enumerated RPC services may reveal critical services like NFS (Network File System) and NIS (Network Information Service). Identifying such services is crucial as they offer significant footholds for exploitation.

- **[Discovering Other RPC-Enabled Services](offensive/network/enumeration/portmapper_enumeration/network_mapping_via_rpc/discovering_other_rpc-enabled_services/):** Beyond NFS and NIS, other RPC-enabled services discovered through enumeration can provide valuable insights into the network environment. Uncovering such services is essential for developing sophisticated attack strategies and understanding the potential attack surface. 

Portmapper Enumeration not only aids in understanding the layout of RPC services across a network but also serves as a critical component for identifying vulnerabilities and preparing subsequent attacks. By effectively utilizing enumeration techniques, offensive cybersecurity operators can efficiently map, analyze, and exploit network services.
