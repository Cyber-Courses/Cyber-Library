# Identifying NFS and NIS Services

## Portmapper Enumeration

Utilize the `rpcinfo` tool to query the portmapper and enumerate available RPC services. Portmapper, a key component of the RPC mechanism, maps RPC program numbers to network port numbers on a Unix/Linux system. The command `rpcinfo -p <target>` provides a comprehensive list of running RPC services, displaying crucial information such as service name, port number, and protocol type. The output details, such as the version and protocol (TCP/UDP), help identify services like NFS and NIS that operate over RPC.

Command Example:
```bash
rpcinfo -p <target_ip>
```

Output Interpretation:
- **Program**: Identifier for the RPC service.
- **Version**: Specific version of the RPC service.
- **Protocol**: The transport protocol (TCP/UDP) used.
- **Port**: Network port the service is bound to.

## Identifying NFS Services

To identify Network File System (NFS) services, focus on specific RPC program numbers that denote its presence. The NFS is typically associated with program number **100003**. By parsing the `rpcinfo` output, one can determine if NFS is running alongside vital services like the mount daemon, often linked by program number **100005**, which manages the client mount requests.

Understanding NFS involves identifying the server's export settings – directories available for remote mounting, scrutinizable via the `showmount` command:

Command Example:
```bash
showmount -e <target_ip>
```

This command reveals exported filesystem paths, their access privileges, and potential vulnerabilities related to access control misconfigurations.

## Identifying NIS Services

For Network Information Service (NIS) identification, locate services using program numbers such as **100004** for `ypserv` and **100007** for `ypbind`. RPC output for these numbers indicates NIS service presence, which centralizes the management of critical network databases like user accounts and hostnames.

NIS services like `ypxfrd`, facilitating database transfers (program number **100069**), are of interest for ensuing lateral movement or privilege escalation efforts within a network.

## Understanding Dependencies and Service Interactions

NFS and NIS often interact with auxiliary services affecting their security posture. For instance, NFS relies on auxiliary services such as `statd` for file locking, identified by program number **100024**. Understanding these interactions enhances mapping of the network’s attack surface and identifying potential chokepoints for exploiting vulnerabilities.

Mapping these interactions through comprehensive RPC enumeration enables security professionals to delineate service communications and identify potential misconfigurations leveraged during attacks.

## Enumeration via Command Line Tools

Automating RPC enumeration can streamline the process of identifying services across multiple systems. Scripts using `rpcclient` or other similar tools can systematically scan for services across a network range, allowing quick identification of potential targets.

Command Example:
```bash
rpcclient <target_ip> -U ''
```

Such automation can include configurations for bypassing security hardening, such as firewalls, presenting a robust methodology for reconnaissance.

## Fishing for Leaks in Data Exchange

Examine captured data between client and NFS/NIS services using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump. Analyzing RPC communication can reveal misconfigurations or sensitive data leakage. Focus on non-secure transmissions for potential usernames, password hashes, or configuration files summary details.

Command Example:
```bash
tcpdump -i <interface> host <target_ip> and port <nfs_port>
```

Network traffic analysis uncovers strategies for exploiting unencrypted exchanges inherent in default RPC communication protocols.

## Attack Vector Development

Using detailed RPC mappings, hackers can exploit NFS configurations to mount unauthorized systems, browsing shared directories for exploitable data. Vulnerabilities in NIS' authentication or configuration due to weak design mechanisms are another avenue for intrusive maneuvers.

Command Example to Mount an NFS Share:
```bash
mount -t nfs <target_ip>:/exported/path /mnt/local_mount
```

Subsequent steps involve leveraging improperly configured exports to navigate internal networks or escalate privileges within compromised systems.

## Cloaking Strategies Post-Enumeration

Post-service enumeration, it is crucial to mitigate detection during offensive operations. This includes techniques to clear system logs (`last`, `dmesg`) and evade intrusion detection systems (IDS). Embedding within RPC environments demands sophisticated measures like using non-standard ports for NFS/NIS traffic or packet fragmentation to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
