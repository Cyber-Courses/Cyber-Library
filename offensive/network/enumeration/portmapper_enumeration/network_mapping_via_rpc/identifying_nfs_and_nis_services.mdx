# Identifying NFS and NIS Services

## Overview of RPC-Based Services

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network. RPC is crucial for network service mapping because it facilitates interaction across networked devices without needing to understand the details of the network's architecture. Portmapper is an essential service that maps RPC programs to network ports, thereby playing a critical role in RPC service discovery and enumeration.

In the context of identifying Network File System (NFS) and Network Information Service (NIS) services, understanding RPC and Portmapper is vital. These services often rely on RPC to operate effectively, and querying Portmapper can reveal crucial information about their presence and configurations on a targeted network.

## NFS and NIS Service Basics

**Network File System (NFS)** is a protocol developed to allow file sharing between systems in a network. It enables various computers to access files over a network as if they were on the local disk. NFS is commonly used in UNIX and Linux environments due to its ease of use and flexibility in integrating disparate systems.

**Network Information Service (NIS)** is another RPC-based service initially developed by Sun Microsystems. It manages distributed directory services and simplifies identity management across a network. NIS centralizes passwords, hostnames, and other information, easing administration tasks for network administrators.

Both NFS and NIS have unique roles in their environments. NFS primarily facilitates shared storage, while NIS handles centralized management of directory information critical for maintaining consistent user, host, and group details across networked systems.

## Portmapper Enumeration for NFS and NIS

The Portmapper service, also known as `rpcbind`, is a critical element in identifying services like NFS and NIS. It acts as a directory, mapping RPC services to the TCP or UDP ports they are running on. By querying the Portmapper service, attackers can uncover running instances of NFS and NIS, as well as other RPC services.

### Techniques for Querying Portmapper

Portmapper can be queried using tools such as `rpcinfo`, a command-line utility designed to make remote procedure calls. By using `rpcinfo`, you can discover what RPC services are registered with the Portmapper and on which ports they are listening. This is the first step in identifying NFS and NIS services in a target network.

Command Example:
```bash
rpcinfo -p <target-ip>
```
This command lists all registered RPC services on the specified target, providing a starting point for further investigation.

## Targeted Scanning Techniques

### Nmap Scripting Techniques

Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, includes scripts specifically designed to identify RPC services. Using Nmap's `rpcinfo` script, you can automate the enumeration process to pinpoint specific services like NFS and NIS.

Command Example:
```bash
nmap -sV --script=rpcinfo <target-ip>
```
This command scans a target IP to discover RPC services and identifies associated details, including NFS and NIS, when present.

### Using RPCinfo and Other Tools

Beyond `rpcinfo`, several advanced tools can be leveraged to drill down into discovered services. These tools allow for more refined queries against the Portmapper to extract further details about the NFS and NIS services, including their versions and supported functionalities.

Each tool and script's output should be cross-referenced for accuracy, confirming the presence and state of identified services.

## Analyzing NFS and NIS Versioning

Knowing the versions of detected NFS and NIS services is crucial, as specific vulnerabilities can only be exploited in particular versions. Using version disclosure, attackers can tailor their tactics and select appropriate exploits capable of compromising the services.

### Techniques for Version Determination

Examining service banners and scrutinizing the output of enumeration tools often provides critical version information. Additionally, explicit querying of the services may yield version details, which can be vital for vulnerability assessment.

## Service-Specific Vulnerability Assessment

### Common Vulnerabilities

NFS and NIS services are historically prone to various vulnerabilities ranging from poor authentication mechanisms to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. By keeping abreast of common security issues related to these services, attackers can quickly assess vulnerabilities present in the target network.

### Tools for Exploitation

Several tools facilitate the exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities in NFS and NIS. These include Metasploit modules designed for penetration testing of NFS configurations and scripts that leverage known exploits for enumerated NIS services.

## Exploiting NFS and NIS Services

Advanced exploitation techniques involve manipulating these services to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate data, or further pivot within a network. By utilizing exploits tailored to specific service configurations and versions, attackers can significantly enhance their ability to compromise the services.

### Post-Exploitation Strategies

After successfully exploiting NFS or NIS, attackers should establish persistence, often by injecting backdoors or configuring cron jobs. They must also focus on extracting sensitive data and maintain stealth as they traverse the network, leveraging compromised systems to access further networked resources.

## Stealth Techniques and Common Evasion Tactics

Stealth is paramount in offensive cybersecurity. Achieving stealth while identifying and exploiting NFS and NIS involves using evasion tactics that minimize network footprint, such as adjusting scan timing and packet size. Advanced users employ encrypted channels and diversified scanning methodologies to avoid detection, ensuring continued access without alerting network defenses.
