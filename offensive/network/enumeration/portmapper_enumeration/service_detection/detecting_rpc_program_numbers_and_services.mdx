# Detecting RPC Program Numbers and Services

## Introduction to RPC Enumeration

Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are a powerful feature used in networked environments to execute a subroutine or procedure in another address space, typically on a different computer within the network. In the realm of cybersecurity, understanding RPC services is crucial since they can expose critical vulnerabilities if improperly managed. RPC services can be run over both TCP and UDP, with their primary method on network communication being transported through the portmapper service (Port 111). Each RPC service is identified by a unique program number, making it essential for penetration testers to discover these numbers during an engagement.

Tools for detecting RPC programs and services include `rpcinfo` and `rpcclient`. These utilities facilitate the enumeration of RPC services, allowing the user to identify available RPC programs on a networked system efficiently.

## Gathering Initial Information

Before diving into explicit RPC program enumeration, it is important to perform a broad scan to understand which services are running and identify any open ports, specifically those that may be hosting RPC services. This often begins with common scanning techniques:

### Scanning Techniques for RPC Services

- **Port Scanning**: The first step involves using tools such as Nmap to scan for open ports, particularly focusing on port 111, commonly used by the portmapper service, which acts as an index of all available RPC services. The command below demonstrates a basic scan for port 111:

  ```bash
  nmap -p 111 <target_host>
  ```

- **Dynamic Port Mapping**: Since RPC services may run on dynamic high-numbered ports assigned by the portmapper, it's crucial to analyze the scan results for both port 111 and any other ports that could potentially host RPC services.

### Mapping Detected Ports to RPC Services

Once specific ports are identified, the next step is to map these to actual services, which involves interpreting port scan results and correlating open ports to known RPC services. This process often requires understanding typical RPC communication patterns and known service behaviors.

## RPC Programs and Version Enumeration

After identifying potential targets, enumerating the available RPC programs becomes pivotal to understanding the network's exposure through these services.

### Enumerating Available RPC Programs

Use `rpcinfo` to query the RPC services by listing available programs and their corresponding version numbers:

```bash
rpcinfo -p <target_host>
```

This command retrieves a list of RPC programs, their program numbers, and versions running on a host. Knowing the version numbers is essential as different versions may be vulnerable to various exploits.

### Prioritizing Programs Based on Target Context

Every RPC program discovered should be evaluated to prioritize based on its relevance to the target context. Critical business applications or services that historically have had vulnerabilities should be noted for further, deeper inspection.

## RPC Program Service Mapping

The aim of this step is to understand how the detected RPC programs relate to active network services and assess their potential risk.

### Discovering Network Service Mappings

- **By RPC Program Number**: Each program number corresponds to a specific service. Cross-reference these numbers against known databases or resources that catalog the typical application of each number, thereby gaining insight into the potential function and exposure of these services.

### Identifying Vulnerable Services

- **Cross-referencing with Vulnerabilities**: Examine identified services against known vulnerabilities using resources such as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. This cross-referencing is pivotal in assessing the risk each RPC service may represent.

## Advanced RPC Enumeration Tactics

Identifying additional enumeration tactics can help in better penetration testing and avoiding detection by system defenses.

### Bypassing Network Restrictions

In scenarios where network restrictions are stringent, identifying and leveraging proxy RPC services can enable continued enumeration. This involves understanding intermediary services that might pass RPC data between endpoints.

### Stealth Techniques for RPC Enumeration

Employing stealth techniques such as modifying scan velocities, using decoy addresses, or embedding RPC queries within legitimate traffic can reduce the risk of detection by network monitoring.

## Exploitation Preparation

Once enumeration pinpoints vulnerabilities, prepare for exploit attempts:

### Preparing Exploit Payloads for Detected RPC Services

Crafting exploit payloads necessitates understanding each identified service's intricacies, accommodating service-specific behaviors and potential vulnerabilities in the payload design.

### Aligning Exploitation Strategies with Identified RPC Versions

Adapt exploitation methods to correspond with the specific RPC versions enumerated to maximize the chance of successful penetration while minimizing unintended disruptions.

### Validating Access Control Bypasses via RPC Exploits

Test potential access control bypasses by leveraging found RPC exploits to ascertain if unauthorized access or escalation of privileges can be achieved.

## Automating RPC Enumeration Processes

To streamline enumeration efforts, automation is essential:

### Scripting Custom RPC Enumeration Tools

Develop custom scripts, potentially using Python or Shell scripting, to automate tasks such as port scanning, RPC program querying, and vulnerability cross-referencing specific to the target network configuration.

### Integrating RPC Enumeration into Automated Testing Pipelines

Incorporate these processes into automated security testing frameworks to ensure continuous monitoring and adaptation as network changes occur, thereby enhancing ongoing defensive measures.
