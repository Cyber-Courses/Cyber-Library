# Identifying Active Users

## Understanding User Activity Patterns

Mapping Active Directory attributes is an essential first step in identifying active users. Active Directory (AD) maintains valuable metadata about user accounts, including last logon times and account activity status. Administrators can leverage attributes such as `lastLogon`, `lastLogonTimestamp`, and `logonCount` to determine user activity patterns. Understanding these attributes allows attackers to discern which user accounts are actively being used, potentially enabling more targeted attacks. For instance, the `lastLogon` attribute is updated with each user authentication, providing a highly accurate reflection of user activity.

Leveraging time stamps for activity analysis involves correlating these AD attributes with time-related data to identify recent account usage. By analyzing logon time stamps and correlating them with network events, attackers can pinpoint active user sessions and predict user behavior. Time-based analysis also helps in identifying dormant accounts, which might indicate expired or unused accounts that could be exploited without immediate detection.

Correlating logon events with network traffic allows forensic analysts to track user activity across the network. By utilizing logs from various sources, such as VPN logs, proxy logs, and SIEM solutions, attackers can build a comprehensive view of user activity. This correlation enables the identification of high-risk users based on unusual or unauthorized access, facilitating more refined targeting strategies.

## Tools for Identifying Active Users

Utilizing PowerShell for active user discovery is a common method due to its integration with Windows environments and powerful scripting capabilities. PowerShell cmdlets such as `Get-ADUser` and `Get-ADComputer` can be used to pull information about active users and connected devices. For instance, the command `Get-ADUser -Filter * -Property displayName, lastLogonTimestamp` can help extract relevant data for further analysis.

Implementing Sysinternals' tools provides additional means to monitor user activity. Tools like `PsLoggedOn` can be used to determine which users are currently logged into a system, while `ProcMon` can track user-generated process activity in real-time. These utilities are valuable for quickly identifying users with active sessions on networked systems.

Employing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems allows for the aggregation and analysis of logs from multiple sources, providing rich insights into user activity. SIEM solutions can highlight anomalies and alert administrators to suspicious activity, assisting in proactive identification of potentially malicious users. By configuring tailored rules, attackers can camouflage their reconnaissance activities within legitimate traffic patterns.

## Active User Enumeration via Network Protocols

Inspecting RDP for active sessions is a direct method to identify active users. Tools like `quser` or `query user` can reveal who is logged in via Remote Desktop, allowing enumeration of active session details. The command `query user /server:targetserver` lists all active RDP sessions, potentially exposing silently connected users.

Leveraging SMB and LDAP queries can yield insights into currently active user sessions. SMB-based tools like `smbclient` can interact with network shares to pull session information, while LDAP queries can extract user details from the AD directory. These protocols can reveal connected users and timings of their interactions with network resources.

Passive observation of DHCP leases is another method for identifying active users by monitoring IP address allocations. DHCP logs can show which devices have been issued IP addresses recently, indicating active use. Analyzing DHCP messages and associations can help pinpoint devices momentarily connected to the network, suggesting the presence of active users.

## Analyzing Login Sessions

Extracting and decoding session data provides the necessary details about user interactions with system services. Through system logs, attackers can retrieve session data, including username, login time, and session duration. This data can be used to identify regular access patterns and detect anomalies.

Identifying concurrent sessions involves monitoring systems for multiple simultaneous logons from a single user account. Such activity might indicate shared credentials or credential misuse. By cross-referencing login sessions across different systems, attackers can assess the extent of concurrent sessions to detect potential policy violations or security risks.

Detecting anomalous login activity involves the application of heuristics and analytical models to identify deviations from normal patterns. Unusual login times, locations, or sequences can flag potential security incidents. For example, a user logging in from one geographic region and shortly after from another suggests potential credential theft.

## Scripting Automated Identification of Active Users

Creating batch scripts for regular checks enables continuous monitoring of active users. Scripts can be developed to run periodically, fetching user activity data without manual intervention. Basic `bash` or `batch` scripts could leverage tools like `quser`, `net user`, or PowerShell commands to automate this task.

Scheduling task automation for repeated activities is accomplished using task schedulers such as cron (Linux) or the Windows Task Scheduler. Tasks can be set to execute scripts at regular intervals, ensuring timely updates of active user data while reducing manual workload.

Utilizing Python for advanced active user identification scripts offers flexibility and feature-rich capabilities for gathering data. Libraries such as `ldap3` for Python can interact with LDAP directories to extract user information programmatically. Python scripts can also interface with various APIs and tools to aggregate data for comprehensive active user profiling.

## Tracking User Logon and Logoff Events

Collecting and parsing event logs forms the basis of user activity profiling. Security logs from systems and devices contain logon and logoff events that can be parsed to create a timeline of user access. Regular analysis of these logs can reveal trends and detect discrepancies in user behavior.

Monitoring group policy and security log indicators is crucial for detecting changes in user access rights and policies. These indicators often reflect attempts to escalate privileges or modify security settings, indicating potential malicious intent. By configuring alerts for specific group policy changes, attackers can track any elevation in a userâ€™s privileges.

Identifying typical user logon patterns involves establishing baseline activity for each user. Deviations from these patterns may suggest unauthorized access. Creating profiles based on historical logon data helps differentiate legitimate users from potential threats.

## Correlating Active Users with Current Network Activities

Associating processes with user accounts allows attackers to identify which active users are performing specific actions on a network. By tracing running processes back to user IDs through logs and system statistics, attackers can ascertain the roles and movements of active users.

Monitoring Active Directory authentication traffic facilitates the detection of authentication requests, granting visibility into who is accessing network services. By analyzing the traffic associated with AD, attackers can profile active users based on their interactions with domain resources. 

Tracking user activity through network shares access is another method to identify users interacting with shared resources. Logs and monitoring tools can track which users are accessing and modifying files over SMB or NFS shares, highlighting potentially unauthorized data access.

## Maintaining Anonymity while Identifying Active Users

Applying TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for OpSec involves the strategic use of known methods to avoid detection. For enumerating active users, this might involve pattern analysis that mimics normal traffic behavior, ensuring anomalies aren't flagged by network defenses.

Obscuring user enumeration activities within network traffic requires attackers to blend their enumeration actions within typical network operations. Techniques like time-based execution and adjusted network traffic rates help mask enumeration activities, simulating legitimate network behavior.

Evading detection by defensive mechanisms necessitates knowledge of existing security controls and countermeasures. Attackers may utilize encryption, protocol manipulation, or mimic authorized tools to avoid triggering security alarms designed to detect enumeration activities.

## Preparing for Detection: Honeytoken Deployments

Deploying decoy accounts for monitoring active enumeration is an effective tactic to track adversaries' attempts to enumerate users. Honeytokens, such as decoy users in AD, provide a tripwire for alerting defenders of unauthorized enumeration.

Setting traps to identify threat actors involves strategically placing these decoy accounts within the network to tease out attackers through their actions. By monitoring interactions with these bait accounts, defenders can profile and trace attacker movements.

Analyzing honeytoken triggers for working counter-responses allows defenders to fine-tune their defense mechanisms and response protocols. Triggers enable immediate alerts and actions to mitigate threats before attackers can capitalize on the information gained from user enumeration.
