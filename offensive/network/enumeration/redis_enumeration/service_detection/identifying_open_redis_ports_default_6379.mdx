# Identifying Open Redis Ports (Default 6379)

## Introduction to Redis Port Scanning Techniques

Scanning for open Redis ports is a crucial step in network enumeration and offensive cybersecurity assessments. Redis, an open-source in-memory data structure store, listens on port 6379 by default. Identifying open Redis ports helps security analysts understand potential risks associated with exposed instances. This knowledge paves the way for further security evaluations such as misconfiguration checks, and version disclosures, potentially highlighting systemic vulnerabilities within a network.

## Network Scanning Tools for Redis Port Identification

Identifying Redis instances primarily involves network scanning tools capable of probing the default port 6379.

### Utilizing Nmap for Redis Port Identification

Nmap is a versatile tool that facilitates the discovery and enumeration of services running on a network. To scan for open Redis ports using Nmap, the following command can be employed:

```sh
nmap -p 6379 <target-IP-range>
```

This command specifically targets port 6379 across a range of IP addresses, allowing for efficient identification of open Redis services. Nmap's output provides detailed information regarding the state of the port (open, closed, or filtered), the running service, and potential version information. Utilizing scripts like `redis-info` with Nmap can further, enhance detection by probing for Redis-specific responses.

### Masscan for Large Network Scans

Masscan is a high-performance scanning tool optimized for scanning large network ranges. Its speed makes it suitable for discovering open Redis ports across extensive infrastructures:

```sh
masscan <target-network> -p6379 --rate=10000
```

This command performs a scan of port 6379 at a specified rate, facilitating rapid identification of open instances across large subnets. Post-scan, Masscan's output can be piped into scripts or tools for further validation and information extraction.

## Bypassing Network Security Measures

Security infrastructures often employ protective measures, requiring scanners to adopt stealthy techniques.

### Techniques to Evade Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

To circumvent network defenses, scanners must employ methods to reduce detection rates. Techniques include packet fragmentation wherein the payload is split across several packets, complicating signature detection. Additionally, randomizing the timing between scans diminishes the likelihood of alerting IDS systems configured to detect sequential scans.

### Circumventing Network Address Translation (NAT)

Identifying services behind NAT setups demands approaches that can reveal and interact through address translations. NAT refers to a method used by routers to modify network address information in IP packet headers. Employing methods such as UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) allows for querying devices for NAT type and external address information, aiding in the identification process.

## Leveraging Custom Scripting for Redis Port Discovery

Beyond conventional scanning tools, custom scripting can deliver tailored scanning capabilities.

### Writing Custom Scripts in Python for Targeted Redis Scanning

Python, with its comprehensive networking libraries such as `socket`, provides developers a robust base for constructing custom Redis discovery scripts:

```python
import socket

def redis_port_scan(ip, port=6379):
    try:
        sock = socket.create_connection((ip, port), timeout=2)
        sock.send("PING\r\n".encode())
        response = sock.recv(1024)
        if b'+PONG' in response:
            return f"Redis detected on {ip}:{port}"
    except socket.error:
        return f"Redis not detected on {ip}:{port}"
    finally:
        sock.close()

```

This script attempts to connect to the specified IP on port 6379 and sends a "PING" command, characteristic of Redis services, looking for a "PONG" response.

## Network Disguise and Stealth Methods

Sophisticated scanning requires blending into normal network traffic to avoid detection.

### Proxying and Tunneling Scans for Redis Ports

Leveraging proxies enables the concealment of scanning origins. Tools like proxychains can route scan traffic through various public proxies:

```sh
proxychains nmap -p 6379 <target-IP>
```

Furthermore, SSH tunneling facilitates secured and masked communication, wherein scan traffic is encapsulated within SSH to traverse network security boundaries undetected.

## Analyzing and Consolidating Scan Results

Efficiency in data handling is crucial for large, automated assessments.

### Efficient Data Parsing Techniques for Large Networks

Handling massive amounts of scan data necessitates tools proficient in parsing and consolidation. Parsing libraries in Python or shell scripting with tools such as `awk`, `sed`, and `grep` enable the extraction of relevant information from bulk outputs. Additionally, output formats like JSON can streamline data ingestion into databases or further processing pipelines.

These comprehensive techniques empower security professionals to systematically uncover Redis ports, evaluate potential vulnerabilities, and support the cybersecurity posture of the assessed network.
