# Identifying CouchDB Users and Roles

## Introduction to CouchDB Enumeration

Understanding the foundation of CouchDB is integral for comprehensively identifying users and roles within the database. CouchDB is a NoSQL database designed to facilitate easy data storage and management on a distributed scale. When exploring user and role administration in CouchDB, it's crucial to grasp how user access and role assignment are encoded within its architecture. In essence, user management is built around user accounts stored within the `_users` database, with roles acting as access control vehicles either assigned directly to these users or applied globally to certain operations within the system.

## Access and Enumeration Techniques

### Unauthenticated Access

Unauthenticated access is often the first step in identifying potential entry points into a CouchDB instance. Many deployments of CouchDB may inadvertently expose themselves to unauthenticated access due to the lack of rigorous administrative setup or oversight. The default HTTP port 5984 is a common vector exploited by attackers. Security misconfigurations, such as unrestricted public network access or weak default security settings, allow attackers to enumerate CouchDB instances without initially providing any form of authentication. By connecting directly to the exposed port, an attacker can probe for accessible endpoints that may leak information on database configuration or active user sessions.

### Authenticated Access

Authenticated access becomes necessary when CouchDB is configured with more secure default settings. Acquiring valid credentials becomes the focus to move forward with systematic enumeration. Tools focusing on credential stuffing or password brute force attacks can be employed to obtain valid user credentials. Brute forcing can be achieved through scripts that repeatedly attempt login using known or guessed username/password combinations, leveraging common admin passwords or exploiting known vulnerabilities in legacy access configurations.

## Enumerating Users in CouchDB

### Accessing _users Database

The `_users` database is a special system database within CouchDB that contains information about all registered users. By querying this database, details regarding individual user accounts can be extracted. Each record is typically stored in JSON format, containing vital authentication and identification information for the user.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5984/_users/_all_docs?include_docs=true
```

This cURL command queries the `_users` database to list all documents while including the full content of each document. Attackers typically target these documents to retrieve usernames and their associated attributes.

### User Document Structure Analysis

Each document within the `_users` database follows a structured JSON format which includes key fields such as `name`, `roles`, and `type`. The `name` field represents the unique identifier for each user, while the `roles` field specifies the user's assigned roles and permissions. Additionally, each document may contain `password_sha` or other authentication-related fields, which can offer insights into the hashing and security mechanisms employed. Understanding this schema enables attackers to meticulously dissect user configurations and infer the respective power dynamics encoded in role assignments.

## Role Identification

### Understanding User Roles

Roles in CouchDB serve as a mechanism to grant permissions and capabilities to users. Predefined roles exist by default, but users can also hold user-defined roles that customize access privileges specific to an organization's tailored needs. The roles are often indicators of the level of privilege and access control a particular user holds, serving as an essential piece of information in evaluating potential attack vectors.

### Role Enumeration Techniques

The `_security` object within each database holds vital information regarding roles and their related access controls. Enumerating roles typically involves querying this security object to extract all pertinent permission details.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5984/database_name/_security
```

Using the above command, the security settings of a specified database are revealed. Within this output, the `admins` and `members` fields indicate which users or roles possess administrative rights or access permissions. Parsing this data can lead to identifying roles with potential avenues for elevation or lateral movements.

## Exploiting Weak Role Configurations

### Privilege Escalation via Role Identification

Exploring roles with excessive privileges provides a gateway for privilege escalation. Roles that are too expansive or poorly defined can potentially be manipulated to gain broader access than initially intended. Identifying and targeting such roles enables attackers to achieve administrative-level privileges or execute operations beyond their original scope of access.

### Exploiting Misconfigurations

Misconfigurations present security issues within role-based access controls. This vulnerability is manifested through improperly defined security rules, overlooked permissions, or overly permissive roles. Leveraging these flaws, attackers can bypass security restrictions and carry out operations with minimal risk of detection.

## Tools and Utilities for Enumeration

### CouchDB-Specific Tools

Tools crafted specifically for CouchDB enumeration, such as custom scripts or common utilities like cURL, enable the targeted extraction of data such as user documents or role configurations, which are crucial in the enumeration phase. These tools may provide comprehensive scanning capabilities to evaluate couchDB's configuration and role setups efficiently.

### Integration with Existing Enumeration Frameworks

Existing security frameworks, such as Metasploit and Nmap, can be extended to target CouchDB enumeration. These tools may offer modules and scripts focused on probing CouchDB for exposed data and security configuration analysis, leveraging network reconnaissance techniques.

## Post-Enumeration Strategies

### Validating Enumeration Success

To validate the enumeration results, cross-referencing acquired user and role data is essential. By ensuring the correctness and reliability of identified users and roles, an attacker can form a solid groundwork for further exploitation, curtailing the likelihood of encountering errors due to incorrect information.

### Strategic Planning for Further Exploitation

Strategic planning follows the enumeration phase, with the aim to capitalize on gathered user and role information. By understanding the roles and permissions structure, attackers can formulate a tactical plan for lateral movements across the network, targeting systems or data previously inaccessible due to inadequate access privileges.
