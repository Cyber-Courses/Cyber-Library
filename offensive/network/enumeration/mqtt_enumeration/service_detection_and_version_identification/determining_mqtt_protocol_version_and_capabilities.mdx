# Determining MQTT Protocol Version and Capabilities

Understanding the MQTT protocol version and capabilities of a broker is crucial in crafting effective offensive strategies. This comprehensive guide delves into various techniques for extracting these details, leveraging network traffic analysis, protocol inspection, and targeted probing.

## Network Traffic Interception for MQTT

### Passive Traffic Analysis

Passive traffic analysis involves monitoring network traffic to identify MQTT communications without actively interacting with the broker. Tools like Wireshark can be employed to capture packets on the network. By listening to communication channels, captured MQTT packets can be analyzed for key protocol elements. Specifically, focus should be placed on CONNECT packets which contain the protocol name and level information that directly correlates to the MQTT version in use.

To effectively utilize passive traffic analysis:
1. Deploy network sniffers on segments where MQTT traffic is expected.
2. Filter captured data to isolate MQTT protocol packets.
3. Pay close attention to the beginning of any MQTT session establishment for accurate version insights.

### Active Traffic Simulation

Active traffic simulation requires sending MQTT protocol packets to the broker to elicit a response. Crafting a simple MQTT CONNECT request and analyzing the broker’s response can provide insights into the supported protocol version and capabilities.

Steps for active traffic simulation include:
1. Use a tool or script to send a crafted MQTT CONNECT packet.
2. Capture the broker's response using network sniffing tools.
3. Analyze the response packet for protocol information, looking for fields in the CONNACK packet that may indicate supported protocol features and configurations.

## Protocol Header Inspection

### Inspecting CONNECT Packet

The CONNECT packet lies at the core of understanding an MQTT broker's protocol version. Key fields within this packet include "Protocol Name" and "Protocol Level." These fields explicitly state the MQTT version; for example, "MQTT" followed by a level of 4 corresponds to MQTT v3.1.1, whereas a level of 5 indicates MQTT v5.0.

Steps to inspect the CONNECT packet:
1. Capture or intercept an MQTT CONNECT packet.
2. Examine the packet’s "Protocol Name" to confirm it specifies "MQTT."
3. Review the "Protocol Level" field to deduce the protocol version according to the MQTT specification.

## Capability Query Techniques

### CONNACK Response Analysis

Once a CONNECT packet is sent, the broker responds with a CONNACK packet, which confirms connection status and broker capabilities. Analyze this response packet to identify session persistence options and supported authentication techniques. 

Key points to consider during analysis:
1. Observe the acknowledgment flags in the CONNACK packet which suggest certain capabilities.
2. Check return codes indicating acceptance or rejection reasons. Certain error codes may be suggestive of specific broker configurations or limitations.

### Will Message Capabilities Inspection

MQTT brokers support "Last Will and Testament" messages, which are sent when a client disconnects unexpectedly. To check this feature, include a will message in the CONNECT request and observe if the broker acknowledges the message.

Execution steps:
1. Include a will message in your MQTT client configuration.
2. Send a CONNECT request and intercept the broker's response.
3. Analyze if the will message parameters are acknowledged, suggesting broker support for this feature.

## Determining Security Features

### TLS/SSL Support Evaluation

Secure communications in MQTT are commonly ensured through TLS/SSL. Determining if a broker supports these protocols is crucial for understanding its security posture. Conduct a TLS handshake and examine the process to understand encryption support levels.

Methodology:
1. Attempt to establish a secure MQTT connection using MQTT clients that support TLS.
2. Capture the handshake process to affirm TLS version and cipher suites used.
3. Review certificates provided during handshake for validity and detail.

### Authentication Mechanism Detection

Determining how a broker handles authentication involves sending requests with various credentials. Evaluate the broker’s response to detect what authentication methods are required or supported.

Procedure for detection:
1. Craft MQTT CONNECT packets with invalid credentials.
2. Observe response codes to understand the broker’s reaction to failed authentication attempts.
3. Infer supported authentication mechanisms based on handling and error messages.

## Version Fingerprinting Techniques

### Error Code and Message Pattern Analysis

Every MQTT version has distinct error handling nuances. By deliberately sending malformed packets or attempting deprecated features, discrepancies in broker responses can be used to fingerprint the exact MQTT version.

Execution approach:
1. Send MQTT requests utilizing known vulnerabilities or obsolescent features.
2. Log and analyze error messages or behavior.
3. Cross-reference with known version-specific error codes to determine protocol version.

### Utilizing MQTT-Specific Tools

Specialized tools for MQTT enumeration can streamline the process of version identification. Tools like `MQTT-PWN` help automate connections, sending multiple packets and payloads to probe broker characteristics.

Using such tools effectively:
1. Deploy tools capable of crafting and sending a wide array of MQTT requests.
2. Utilize in-built functions for automated scanning and enumeration tasks.
3. Analyze results provided by these tools to pinpoint version and capability specifics.

By employing these comprehensive techniques, operators can efficiently determine the version and capabilities of MQTT servers in their environment, enabling better-informed decisions in subsequent offensive operations.
