### Identifying MQTT Brokers on Network

Detecting MQTT brokers within a network requires a thorough understanding of the MQTT protocol and the infrastructure layout. MQTT, which stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, is a lightweight messaging protocol commonly used in IoT systems. Identifying MQTT brokers is crucial for offensive cybersecurity operations, as these brokers can be entry points into networks or targets for data interception.

#### Overview of MQTT

MQTT operates primarily over TCP/IP, designed for devices with limited processing power and bandwidth. It works on a publish-subscribe model where clients communicate indirectly via a central broker. Understanding this model is essential in identifying brokers within a network, as it highlights the central role brokers play in facilitating messages between clients.

#### Network Scanning Techniques

Network scanning is a fundamental method for locating MQTT brokers. Tools like Nmap, Masscan, or Zmap can be used for this purpose. These tools scan the network for open ports, identifying devices that might be running MQTT services. Given the light-weight nature of MQTT, brokers may be deployed on various hardware from powerful servers to minimal IoT devices, requiring diverse scanning approaches.

Example Command:
```bash
nmap -p 1883,8883 <target-network-range>
```

This command will probe for common MQTT ports across the target network, providing initial insights into where MQTT services may be hosted.

#### Port Scanning for MQTT

MQTT brokers typically listen on port 1883 for unsecured connections and 8883 for SSL/TLS encrypted communications. Port scanning focuses on these ports for availability within a network. Identifying brokers involves differentiating them from other services operating on the same or similar ports. Specialized tools or tailored scripts can effectively automate this identification by filtering results based on known MQTT signatures.

Example Command:
```bash
nmap -sV -p 1883,8883 <target-ip>
```

This command includes the `-sV` flag for service version detection, which helps cross-reference known MQTT broker signatures.

#### Service Banner Grabbing

Banner grabbing involves interrogating a service running on an open port to extract information about the software and version. This process is particularly useful when scanning for known MQTT broker implementations such as Mosquitto or HiveMQ, which often present recognizable banners. Tools like Netcat or Telnet can establish a connection to an MQTT service to solicit banner information.

Example Command:
```bash
nc -v <broker-ip> 1883
```

This command attempts a raw connection to the broker, where any banner information is immediately visible upon connection.

#### Identifying MQTT Traffic Patterns

MQTT traffic can often be discerned by examining packet structures and characteristic patterns. Packet capture tools such as Wireshark can be employed to sniff network traffic looking for specific MQTT signatures such as MQTT CONNECT, SUBSCRIBE, or PUBLISH packet types. These patterns are distinct and can reveal the presence of broker communications.

#### Passive Network Monitoring

Passive monitoring allows for target detection without alerting via active scans. Network monitoring tools, such as Zeek or Suricata, can log network packets over time. By analyzing this data for MQTT-specific traffic, you can infer broker locations and active MQTT communications without touching the devices directly.

#### Discovering Broker Hostnames

Beyond IP addresses, uncovering the hostnames of MQTT brokers can provide further context for network mapping. DNS enumeration techniques or analyzing local name service configurations for relevant records can assist in associating brokers with broader network infrastructure. Consistently, reverse DNS lookups might also come in handy to reveal hostnames.

#### Correlating MQTT Brokers with Network Infrastructure

Mapping MQTT brokers in relation to broader network devices helps distinguish critical assets from less pertinent targets. Once potential brokers are discovered, correlating these with known service records, infrastructure maps, or asset catalogs can prioritize offensive lines of operation, identifying brokers linked to high-value systems or data flows.

#### Enumeration of Public MQTT Brokers

Public broker enumeration exploits services like Shodan, which index publicly accessible devices, including MQTT brokers. Accessing these resources can uncover unsecured or poorly configured brokers exposed to the internet, serving as potential targets for Data Acquisition or Information Gathering stages.

Example Search:
```plaintext
port:1883
```

This Shodan search query returns results for entities running MQTT services on the default insecure port.

#### Automation Scripting for MQTT Detection

Automation enhances efficiency in detecting MQTT brokers in extensive networks. Custom scripts using frameworks like Python's Scapy or Golang's net library can replicate manual scan and banner grabbing activities, ensuring consistency and scalability in operations. These scripts integrate network scanning, service interrogation, and pattern recognition into a seamless process, augmenting human effort with computational power.
