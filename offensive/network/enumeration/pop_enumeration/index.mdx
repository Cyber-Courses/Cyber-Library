## POP Enumeration

### Service Detection
Detecting services operating on a network is a foundational step in POP enumeration, which involves identifying open ports, understanding protocol versions, and pinpointing SSL/TLS services.

#### [Identify Open Ports](offensive/network/enumeration/pop_enumeration/service_detection)
Open ports are often the first indication of a POP server. Commonly, POP3 uses TCP port 110, while its secured version, POP3S, often operates on port 995.

1. **Nmap Scanning**: 
   ```bash
   nmap -p 110,995 <target-IP>
   ```
   This command will probe the target for the traditional ports used by POP services.

2. **Non-Standard Port Analysis**:
   Expand your scan to a wider range of ports if standard ones show no results:
   ```bash
   nmap -p 1-65535 --min-rate=1000 <target-IP>
   ```

- Further details on this can be found [here](offensive/network/enumeration/pop_enumeration/service_detection/identifying_open_pop_ports_110_995/).

#### [Protocol Version Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/pop_enumeration/service_detection/detecting_pop_server_implementations/)
Understanding the specific server implementation provides insight into potential vulnerabilities.

1. **nmap Version Detection**:
   ```bash
   nmap -sV -p 110,995 <target-IP>
   ```
   The `-sV` flag attempts to determine the service version using a variety of techniques, including banner grabbing.

2. **Manual Telnet**:
   Connect using telnet to observe immediate responses:
   ```bash
   telnet <target-IP> 110
   ```

#### [SSL/TLS Service Identification](offensive/network/enumeration/pop_enumeration/service_detection)
When encryption is implemented, additional reconnaissance is necessary.

1. **SSL Enumeration with Nmap**:
   ```bash
   nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 995 <target-IP>
   ```
   Compile information on supported ciphers and protocols offered by the server.

### Banner Grabbing
Acquiring server banners can disclose crucial details like software versions and configurations.

#### [Extracting Server Version and Configuration](offensive/network/enumeration/pop_enumeration/banner_grabbing/extracting_server_version_and_configuration/)
Extracting server banners provides actionable intelligence for further exploitation.

1. **Direct Telnet Connection**:
   Retrieve initial banner information:
   ```bash
   telnet <target-IP> 110
   ```

2. **Netcat Usage**:
   Another alternative for banner discovery:
   ```bash
   nc <target-IP> 110
   ```

#### [Identifying Security Mechanisms from Banners](offensive/network/enumeration/pop_enumeration/banner_grabbing/identifying_security_mechanisms_from_banners/)
Banners often reveal if security enhancements are in effect, like authentication or encryption features.

- Tool Example:
  Use an Nmap script to parse banners for security mechanism clues.

### User Enumeration
Gaining insights into valid user accounts on the POP server can guide further offensive actions.

#### [Using VRFY or EXPN Commands for User Discovery](offensive/network/enumeration/pop_enumeration/user_enumeration/using_vrfy_or_expn_commands_for_user_discovery/)
Designed originally for SMTP, these commands may be tested on multi-functional servers that could be incorrectly configured.

- Example script to test user existence:
  ```bash
  echo "VRFY user@example.com" | nc <target-IP> 110
  ```

#### [Analyzing POP Authentication Responses](offensive/network/enumeration/pop_enumeration/user_enumeration/analyzing_pop_authentication_responses/)
Monitor different server responses to hone in on legitimate usernames.

1. **Command for Brute-Force Tools** (e.g., Hydra):
   ```bash
   hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt <target-IP> pop3 -vV
   ```
   Substitute `user.txt` and `pass.txt` with your wordlists.

2. **Timing Attacks**:
   Script variations in response times to guess user validity:
   ```bash
   # Sample pseudocode for timing analysis
   connect_to_pop()
   start_time = current_time()
   authenticate("known_user", "wrong_pass")
   if response_time > threshold
       log "Potential valid user"
   ```
