### Listing Users with WinRM Access

#### Understanding WinRM and Its Role in Remote Management

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a vital component of Windows operating systems, enabling administrators to execute remote commands and manage networked systems efficiently. WinRM operates as a server that communicates using the WS-Management Protocol, allowing for management tasks over the network. It's built on top of HTTP/HTTPS, making it robust for remote operations without the need for additional local administrative tools. In the context of cybersecurity and offensive strategies, understanding which users have access to WinRM is crucial for identifying potential targets that can facilitate lateral movements within a network.

WinRM must be explicitly enabled and configured on Windows systems, and its use is dependent on service status, firewall rules, and local security policies. Administrative privileges are generally required to configure and operate WinRM, although non-administrative access can sometimes be inadvertently configured, presenting a security risk.

#### Techniques for Enumerating WinRM User Access

##### Leveraging Built-In Windows Tools

Windows provides several built-in options for managing and querying WinRM configurations. One of the most straightforward tools to utilize is Windows PowerShell. Using the `winrm` command-line tool, administrators can directly configure and audit WinRM settings. Here’s how PowerShell can assist in WinRM user enumeration:

- **PowerShell Cmdlets**: Use the `Get-PSSessionConfiguration` cmdlet to list all session configurations available on a host and view the users permitted to use them. Command example:
  ```powershell
  Get-PSSessionConfiguration | Select-Object Name, Permission
  ```
  This command retrieves session configuration names and their associated permission sets, highlighting users with access.

##### Querying Using PowerShell Scripting

Automation of user enumeration can be achieved through custom PowerShell scripting. Such scripts can loop through accounts and permissions, checking explicitly for WinRM access. A simple script example might iterate over known session configurations while filtering relevant access:

```powershell
$configs = Get-PSSessionConfiguration
foreach ($config in $configs) {
    Write-Host "Session Configuration: $($config.Name)"
    Write-Host "Permissions: $($config.Permission)"
}
```

By reviewing and filtering through these permissions, specific user accounts that possess WinRM access can be identified efficiently.

#### Utilizing Network Protocols for WinRM Access Enumeration

##### SMB and RPC Enumeration

Using network protocols such as SMB (Server Message Block) and RPC (Remote Procedure Call), security professionals can extract additional details pertaining to user accounts. SMB, in particular, can reveal more about how resources are shared and accessed, including WinRM configurations.

Network-based enumeration might use tools like `rpcclient` for Samba or direct `SMB` connections to probe user details:
```bash
rpcclient -U "" <Target_IP> -c "enumdomusers"
```
This command targets remote domains to list user names which could include those granted WinRM permissions.

##### LDAP Queries

Leveraging LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) allows querying of the directory to gather user information specific to a domain. Effective on networks with directory services (typically AD environments), LDAP queries can determine user permissions and roles.

Example LDAP query for WinRM-relevant group membership:
```bash
ldapsearch -LLL -H ldap://<DomainController> -b "dc=example,dc=com" "(memberOf=CN=WinRMUsers,OU=Groups,DC=example,dc=com)" cn
```
This command requests user details from the directory associated with a specified group, revealing WinRM access users.

#### Exploiting Vulnerabilities to List WinRM Users

##### Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities

Exploiting WinRM-related vulnerabilities involves understanding publicly known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that can be used to bypass security controls. Attackers may leverage these to escalate privileges or directly enumerate unauthorized user information.

By monitoring and assessing vulnerabilities that specifically target WinRM misconfigurations, attackers can deduce a list of potentially exploitable users.

#### Tools and Frameworks for Automated Enumeration

##### Popular Enumeration Tools

Several tools in the offensive security toolkit streamline the process of WinRM enumeration. `CrackMapExec` is one such tool:
```bash
crackmapexec winrm <Target_IP> -u <Username> -p <Password> --users
```
This command will authenticate and list users with active WinRM sessions, providing quick insights into accessible accounts.

Frameworks such as Metasploit may also include modules specifically targeting WinRM enumeration to automatically retrieve user data. Employing these tools can simplify an otherwise manual enumeration process.

#### Post-Enumeration Strategy

##### Analysis and Prioritization

After collecting data on users with WinRM access, analysis should follow to pinpoint high-value targets — typically accounts with elevated privileges or access to critical resources. This analysis assists in strategizing further lateral movement within a network.

A robust methodology for analysis involves not only listing users but cross-referencing each with known roles or sensitive data access patterns to assess their potential impact within the network.

#### Cross-Referencing with Identifying Privileged Roles for Remote Management

The enumeration of WinRM users becomes more impactful when combined with an evaluation of privileged roles. Identifying connections between the two allows attackers to assess the risk associated with each user. This strategy aids in building a complete picture of the attack surface, targeting specific vectors that could maximize strategic advantages within the network environment.
