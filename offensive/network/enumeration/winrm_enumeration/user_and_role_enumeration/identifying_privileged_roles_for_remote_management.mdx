### Identifying Privileged Roles for Remote Management

#### Introduction to Privileged Roles for Remote Management

In offensive cybersecurity, the ability to access and manage remote systems is critical. Privileged roles allow a user to execute sensitive operations on remote machines, often encompassing administrative powers. Identifying such roles is pivotal for penetration testers and red teamers seeking to understand the attack surface and exploit potential security weaknesses within a target network.

Privileged roles typically involve users who have administrative access, can deploy software, modify crucial system settings, or manage user accounts remotely. In a Windows environment, these roles might be associated with memberships in groups such as Administrators, Remote Desktop Users, and Hyper-V Administrators, among others. Recognizing which accounts or groups have such capabilities is essential for mapping out attack vectors or performing privilege escalation.

#### Tools and Techniques for Enumerating Privileged Roles

##### PowerView & PowerShell

PowerView is a powerful PowerShell tool used to gain insight into Active Directory environments. By leveraging PowerView, attackers can enumerate users and groups, identify role memberships, and determine who has remote management privileges. Key commands include:

```powershell
# Enumerate all members of the Administrators group
Get-NetGroupMember -GroupName "Administrators"

# List users within the Remote Desktop Users group
Get-NetGroupMember -GroupName "Remote Desktop Users"

# Identify all groups with potential remote management capabilities
Get-NetGroup -AdminCount | foreach { Get-NetGroupMember $_ }
```

These PowerShell commands help to quickly identify users and groups with specific administrative roles crucial for remote management tasks.

##### BloodHound

BloodHound uses graph theory to visually map out relationships in Active Directory and identify paths to higher privileges. Upon executing BloodHound in a compromised domain, operators can zero in on roles with the ability to manage systems remotely. BloodHound's data collector ingests this information, which is then visualized, illustrating potential privilege escalation paths.

**Running BloodHound** typically involves the following steps:

1. Execute the data collector on a domain-joined system.
2. Import the collected data into the BloodHound GUI.
3. Use queries to identify administrative roles and group memberships connected to remote management capabilities.

#### Automating the Discovery of Privileged Roles

Automating the identification process can lead to significant efficiency gains during engagements. Creating scripts that employ PowerShell or utilize BloodHound's APIs allows operators to perform rapid, automated enumeration of privileged roles. Here is an example of an automated PowerShell script:

```powershell
# Automated script to identify key privileged groups
$privilegedGroups = @("Administrators", "Remote Desktop Users", "Hyper-V Administrators")
foreach ($group in $privilegedGroups) {
    Get-NetGroupMember -GroupName $group | Out-File -Append -FilePath PrivilegedRoles.txt
}
```

Ensuring that such scripts are fine-tuned and tested can enhance the speed and accuracy of role enumeration in an environment.

#### Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

WMI is a powerful service for system management and often serves as a vector for identifying systems and users with remote management privileges. Using the WMI command-line tool (WMIC), attackers can query user and group memberships to detect privileged roles.

Example commands might include:

```shell
# Query members of Administrators group using WMIC
wmic group where "name='Administrators'" get /value

# Enumerate Remote Desktop Users group membership
wmic RDTOgroup get Caption, Domain, LocalAccount, Name, Status
```

These commands help uncover deeply embedded roles that standard enumeration techniques may miss.

#### Analyzing Group Policy for Privileged Access

Group Policy Objects (GPOs) often dictate who has remote management capabilities. Examination of GPOs can reveal roles that have been granted high-level privileges. By assessing GPO settings and applying security filtering principles, practitioners can unearth configurations granting elevated permissions.

PowerShell scripts or third-party tools can automate this process by exporting GPO settings for review:

```powershell
# Export GPOs to an XML file
Get-GPOReport -All -ReportType XML -Path "C:\GPOReports\GPOReport.xml"
```

Review these exports to spot any GPOs defining privileged access for users or groups beyond the default settings.

#### Network-based Enumeration

Roles involved in remote management often have access to network services and shares that others do not. Tools for network enumeration, such as Nmap and SharpHound (from the BloodHound suite), can help identify machines and roles connected to critical infrastructure services. This cross-verification aids in pinpointing privileged accounts beyond a single point-in-time observation.

Example command using Nmap:

```shell
# Scan the network to find open SMB ports which might be leveraged by privileged accounts
nmap -p 139,445 -T4 -A -v 192.168.1.0/24
```

#### Post-Exploitation: Verification of Privileged Roles

Once roles are identified, verifying entailments through post-exploitation tactics is a natural progression. This could involve lateral movement techniques or credential harvesting tools such as Mimikatz to authenticate as identified users and test their access levels. This not only validates initial findings but also highlights practical access points for threat actors.

#### Defensive Evasion through Privileged Role Management

Operational success often hinges on remaining undetected. Use techniques that bypass or deceive SIEM logging and monitoring systems. Mimicking legitimate user activity, using stealth commands, and monitoring systems from secure locations are just a few strategies to navigate identified roles without raising alarms.
