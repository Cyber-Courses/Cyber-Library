### Network Scanning and Identification Tools

Utilizing tools such as Nmap and Masscan is critical when scanning networks for open Telnet ports. Nmap, renowned for its comprehensive scanning capabilities, allows users to detect open ports on a targeted network. For Telnet, the specific command would be:

```bash
nmap -p 23 <target-IP>
```

This command performs a basic check to identify if port 23 is open on the target system. For more exhaustive enumeration, Nmap also supports a variety of scan types that can offer deeper insights into the network and its services.

Masscan, on the other hand, is designed for high-speed scanning and can be utilized to quickly identify open Telnet ports across extensive IP ranges. Its command format, tailored for port 23, is:

```bash
masscan -p23 <target-IP-range> --rate=<packets-per-second>
```

This flexibility in packet rate control allows it to operate under stealthier conditions, reducing the chance of detection.

### Advanced Port Scanning Techniques

To ensure the discovery of open Telnet ports remains undetected, using advanced scanning techniques like TCP SYN scanning can be beneficial. TCP SYN scans are less intrusive than full connection scans, as they involve sending just a SYN packet and waiting for a SYN-ACK response, indicating an open port.

With Nmap, the command syntax would generally involve:

```bash
nmap -sS -p 23 <target-IP>
```

The stealth factor in TCP SYN scans is significant because they do not complete the TCP handshake, thus often bypassing basic firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

### Evading Detection While Scanning

To minimize the risk of detection, configuring scans to employ rate limiting and timing adjustments is essential. Slowing down scans prevents a flood of requests, which can flag security systems. In Nmap, this can be achieved by:

```bash
nmap -p 23 -T2 <target-IP>
```

This command adjusts timing templates, where `-T2` signifies a polite scan that blends higher delay between packets and reduces the risk of being logged.

For heightened anonymity, utilizing proxy chains or VPN tunnels can obscure the scanner's origin. By routing traffic through multiple nodes, the source IP address becomes obscured.

### Cross-Referencing Open Ports

Once a list of open ports is acquired, cross-referencing these with active hosts to eliminate false positives is crucial. Tools like fping or hping can verify if the hosts on which port 23 was detected are actively responding:

```bash
fping -a -g <target-IP-range>
```

Initiating such checks ensures that subsequent service detection and exploitation efforts are directed only at legitimate targets.

### Automation of Telnet Port Detection

Automating the scanning process can dramatically improve efficiency in environments where continuous monitoring is necessary. Writing scripts in Bash or Python to automate Nmap commands facilitates scheduled and recurring scans. For instance, a simple Bash script could look like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
nmap -p 23 -iL targets.txt -oN telnet_scan_results.txt
```

Cron jobs can then be scheduled to execute this script at desired intervals, ensuring ongoing surveillance of critical infrastructure.

### Post-Detection Analysis

Once open Telnet ports are identified, analyzing these findings within a broader network context helps prioritize targets. Focus can be placed on integrating this data into network topology mapping tools to visually interpret the network's layout. Applications like Maltego or GNS3 can use scan results to draft an interactive network design, highlighting vulnerable pathways.

### Reporting and Log Maintenance

Maintaining detailed logs and reports of open Telnet ports is vital as it serves as a foundation for further investigation or exploitation attempts. Documenting findings in a structured format makes it easier to communicate vulnerabilities to relevant stakeholders. Utilizing systems that automate the integration of scan results into vulnerability management platforms ensures that discoveries translate into actionable security tasks. Tools such as Nessus or OpenVAS can be updated with Telnet port data to augment their threat intelligence databases.
