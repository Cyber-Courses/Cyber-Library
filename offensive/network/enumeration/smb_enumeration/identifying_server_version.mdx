## Identifying Server Version

### SMB Protocol Basics

The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network. Initially developed by IBM in the mid-1980s, SMB has undergone several iterations with significant enhancements in each version. The understanding of SMB protocol basics is crucial for effectively identifying the server version.

#### Protocol Versions and History

SMB has evolved through several versions, with SMBv1 being the original version that dates back to the 1980s. SMBv2 was introduced by Microsoft with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, offering significant performance improvements and security enhancements. SMBv3, launched with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, added further enhancements such as encryption and better performance over high latency networks.

Each SMB version has specific dialects associated with server products, making it important to understand the particular version when assessing a network. Knowing version history can help determine the capabilities, weaknesses, and security measures inherent in the server deployment.

#### Packet Structure

SMB operates by exchanging packets between client and server, containing structured data. These include fields for command codes, flags, status codes, and data payloads. Understanding packet structure is essential for interpreting responses from the server, allowing the identification of version-specific characteristics. Each protocol version has a distinct field arrangement and flag settings, which can be used to discern the server version during enumeration tasks.

### Techniques for Version Identification

SMB version identification can be accomplished through various techniques, each leveraging different aspects of the protocol's behavior and response characteristics.

#### Banner Grabbing via SMB

Banner grabbing involves connecting to a service and retrieving information that reveals the server version. For SMB, this entails initiating a connection and capturing the initial response or error messages. Often, SMB servers disclose version information in these responses, providing an easy method for identification.

#### Parsing Error Messages

SMB servers sometimes return version-specific error messages. By deliberately inducing errors, such as incorrect command parameters or unsupported requests, one can analyze the resulting error codes and messages. These rejections often contain clues about the server's capabilities and version.

#### NTLMSSP Negotiate Response

The NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLMSSP) is used during the authentication process of SMB communication. By capturing and interrogating the NTLMSSP negotiate response, one can determine the server's specific SMB dialect. This method revolves around analyzing the negotiate protocol messages which exchange when the connection is being set up.

#### SMB2 Protocol Support

Detecting support for SMB2 (or later) protocols can hint at the server version. Since SMB2 was introduced in later versions of Windows, its presence typically indicates a more recent deployment. Scanning for the ability to negotiate SMB2 or SMB3 protocols can quickly eliminate legacy systems from consideration.

### Automated Tools and Scripts

Automation tools streamline the process of identifying server versions by applying systematic techniques through scripting and existing software applications.

#### Nmap Script Engine

Nmap's scripting engine includes a range of scripts for SMB enumeration, such as the `smb-protocols` NSE script. This script automates connections and analyses responses to deduce the available SMB versions on the target server.

**Command Example**:
```bash
nmap --script smb-protocols -p 445 <target>
```

#### Metasploit Module

Metasploit provides auxiliary modules specifically for discovering SMB capabilities. By running these modules, you capture dialogues between the client and server that reveal the server’s configuration and supported SMB versions.

**Command Example**:
```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
run
```

#### Custom Scripting

Scripts written in languages like Python or PowerShell can effectively query SMB servers. They can be designed to send specific SMB queries and process the responses for version identification. Scripts might target specific message types or error responses, with the aim of non-intrusively discerning server details.

### Protocol Analysis with Wireshark

Wireshark offers deep packet inspection capabilities that are invaluable for SMB analysis. Using Wireshark, security professionals can capture network traffic to analyze protocols and discover server details.

#### Capture Filter Setup

To efficiently monitor SMB traffic, set up a capture filter that isolates SMB traffic, usually on port 445. This reduces extraneous data capture, focusing solely on pertinent exchanges.

**Example Filter**:
```
tcp.port == 445
```

#### Analyzing Handshake Packets

The initial handshake packets between SMB clients and servers are rich with information. By examining these packets, one can determine the server version and capabilities, since they must advertise supported protocols and negotiate with the client.

#### Exporting Analysis Results

Wireshark allows users to document their findings by exporting data such as packet analyses or using specific comments. This functionality is useful for creating audit trails or producing evidence for documentation purposes.

### Advanced Enumeration Techniques

By integrating results from advanced enumeration methods, one can extend their understanding beyond mere versioning into a comprehensive assessment of server configurations and their implications.

#### Combining Enumeration Results

Synthesizing information from related areas, like extracted user accounts or shared directories, can yield insights tied to specific SMB implementations. Each piece of data might subtly confirm assumptions about the server version.

#### Machine Learning for Fingerprinting

Basic machine learning techniques can be applied to correlate traffic patterns with specific server versions. Although not widely implemented, such methods have the potential to automate and refine the fingerprinting process, identifying subtle markers in SMB communications that are consistent with particular implementations.

### Mitigation Evasion Techniques

While enumerating SMB server versions, it is critical to avoid detection by defensive measures employed by the network or system administrators.

#### Avoiding Honeypots and Traps

Skilled attackers must be able to distinguish genuine servers from honeypots—decoy systems designed to detect unauthorized or malicious use. By analyzing unusual response times or inconsistencies in server behavior, one can minimize the risk of triggering these traps.

#### Timing and Session Control

Conducting operations with timing variations and session controls helps evade detection mechanisms. Coordinated actions that simulate legitimate user behavior usually involve spreading enumeration attempts over time to avoid threshold-based monitoring systems.
