# Enumerating Permissions in SMB

## Introduction to Enumerating Permissions

SMB, or Server Message Block, is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and request services from server programs in a computer network. Proper enumeration of permissions within SMB shares is crucial for identifying potential security vulnerabilities. Understanding the various types of permissions is vital for ethical hackers and penetration testers, as it assists in gaining unauthorized access or escalating privileges on network systems. Differences between share permissions, NTFS permissions, and user/group permissions should be clearly understood to execute precise enumeration strategies.

### Overview of SMB Permissions

In SMB, permissions dictate the access level and actions that authenticated users or groups can perform on shared resources. These permissions can be set at both the share level and the file system level (NTFS) and determine whether a user can read, write, modify, or execute files or applications stored on the network.

### Importance of Enumerating Permissions in Offensive Operations

Enumerating permissions is a critical component of offensive cybersecurity operations. By accurately identifying permissions, attackers can map out potential penetration points, misuse permissions to execute unauthorized actions, and reveal weak points in access control policies that need to be fortified.

### Differences between Share, NTFS, and User Permissions

- **Share Permissions**: These permissions are set on the shared network resources and apply when accessing files and folders through the network. Share permissions are less detailed and commonly include read, change, and full control.
  
- **NTFS Permissions**: These permissions apply to files and folders stored on disk partitions formatted with NTFS. They are more granular than share permissions and include actions such as read, write, execute, modify, etc.

- **User and Group Permissions**: Configured to manage the rights of individual users and groups, these permissions dictate what each user is permitted to do within the SMB environment. User-based permissions ensure that only authorized individuals can access or manipulate certain data.

## Understanding Permission Types in SMB

Understanding the different types of permissions available in an SMB environment is key to effectively conducting reconnaissance and penetration testing. Both Share and NTFS permissions affect how resources are accessed over a network and directly on a computer.

### Overview of Share Permissions

Share permissions are set on folders that have been shared out on the network. The levels of permissions typically include:

- **Read**: Users can view file and folder names, execute programs, and read file data. They cannot modify or delete files.

- **Change**: Users can do everything included in Read, plus they can edit, delete, and create new files or folders.

- **Full Control**: Users have complete control over the files and folders, allowing all actions permissible by Read and Change levels.

### Overview of NTFS Permissions

NTFS permissions provide more fine-grained control over files and folders than share permissions, allowing the assignment of specific rights to individual users and groups. Permissions include:

- **Read**: Allows users to open and read files and folders.

- **Write**: Permits users to modify existing files or create new ones.

- **Execute**: Users can run executable files or scripts.

- **Modify**: Combination of Read and Write permissions plus deletion privileges.

- **Full Control**: Complete administrative rights, including permission to alter security settings.

### Overview of User and Group Permissions

Permissions can be tailored to individual users or user groups, providing specific access levels based on organizational needs and security policies. Correct configuration of these permissions is critical to maintaining security integrity while fostering collaboration within teams.

## Tools for SMB Permission Enumeration

Several tools are available to security professionals for probing SMB environments and revealing permission setups. Key tools include Enum4linux, SMBMap, and CrackMapExec. These tools offer varied functionalities and depth in their analysis of permissions, allowing cybersecurity professionals to ascertain the security posture of SMB shares.

### Commonly Used Tools (e.g., Enum4linux, SMBMap, CrackMapExec)

- **Enum4linux**: This tool is used to retrieve information from Windows systems, including usernames, group names, share names, and share permissions, leveraging NetBIOS, SMB, and LDAP protocols.
  
- **SMBMap**: A tool explicitly designed to evaluate active directories and expose accessible files and certain attributes, such as writeable shares, leveraging native SMB protocols.
  
- **CrackMapExec**: A powerful post-exploitation tool that facilitates enumerating user-level credentials and permissions across a wider network.

### Installation and Configuration of Tools

Installing these tools generally involves downloading from repositories, such as GitHub, and ensuring required dependencies are met. Configuration typically includes setting up command-line options to target specific IP addresses or hosts within a network for authenticating and extracting SMB share information.

## SMBMap for Enumerating Permissions

SMBMap is a versatile tool for enumerating permissions across SMB shares, providing detailed insights into share accessibility and specific user permissions.

### Leveraging SMBMap for Share Permission Enumeration

SMBMap aims to detect open shares within target networks by listing all available SMB shares and deducing permission settings associated with those shares. Users can execute list commands to discover which shares are publicly accessible or locked down. 

Example Command:
```bash
smbmap -H <target-ip> -u <username> -p <password>
```

### Identifying Writeable Shares

Through SMBMap's analysis features, security professionals can identify shares that are writeable by inspecting permission levels, making it possible to plan exploitation strategies. Unauthorized writeable access points signify potential privilege escalation opportunities.

Example Command:
```bash
smbmap -H <target-ip> -R
```

### Gathering Detailed User and Group Permission Data

SMBMap enables the detailed analysis of user and group permissions through options that export discovered data into readable formats, allowing thorough post-enumeration review.

Example Command:
```bash
smbmap -H <target-ip> --permissions
```

## CrackMapExec for Advanced Permission Enumeration

CrackMapExec expands upon standard enumeration practices, delivering an advanced mechanism for user and system-level permission mapping.

### Using CrackMapExec for Enumerating User-Level Permissions

This tool provides options to authenticate against SMB shares and ascertain granular permissions, exposing user-specific access credentials alongside share enumerations that inform the current access control landscape.
