# Enumeration Techniques in Network Offensive Security

## HTTP Enumeration
HTTP enumeration involves evaluating web servers for configuration details, directory structures, and potential vulnerabilities. By uncovering the HTTP server type and version, attackers can identify known vulnerabilities associated with the specific software in use. HTTP header analysis is critical for extracting cookies, server configurations, and other information that can be leveraged in further attacks.

- [Header Analysis](offensive/network/enumeration/Header Analysis/)
- [Unprotected Resources](offensive/network/enumeration/Unprotected Resources/)

## FTP Enumeration
FTP enumeration targets the discovery of shared files, directory structures, and the presence of anonymous access. Anonymous login can be verified to check for misconfigurations or overly permissive access rights, revealing confidential or sensitive data stored on the server.

- [Directory and File Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/Directory and File Enumeration/)
- [Anonymous Access Verification](offensive/network/enumeration/Anonymous Access Verification/)

## SSH Enumeration
In SSH enumeration, attackers identify authentication mechanisms and potential weaknesses in the SSH service configurations. This process includes detecting supported key exchange protocols and cipher suites to assess the potential for exploiting weak cryptographic implementations.

- [Authentication Mechanisms Analysis](offensive/network/enumeration/Authentication Mechanisms Analysis/)

## DNS Enumeration
DNS enumeration involves techniques like zone transfers and reverse DNS lookups to gather information about domain configurations. By analyzing DNS records, attackers can discover subdomains, A, MX, and other record types that provide a comprehensive map of the target's online presence and infrastructure.

- [Zone Transfers](offensive/network/enumeration/Zone Transfers/)
- [DNS Record Analysis](offensive/network/enumeration/DNS Record Analysis/)
- [Subdomain Discovery](offensive/network/enumeration/Subdomain Discovery/)
- [Reverse DNS Lookup](offensive/network/enumeration/Reverse DNS Lookup/)

## SFTP Enumeration
SFTP enumeration focuses on discovering accessible files and directory structures, authentication configurations, and analyzing file transfer logs for unauthorized activity. This is essential for understanding the flow and storage of critical data within an organization's network.

- [Authentication Mechanisms Analysis](offensive/network/enumeration/Authentication Mechanisms Analysis/)
- [Directory and File Listing](offensive/network/enumeration/Directory and File Listing/)

## VoIP Enumeration
VoIP enumeration is used to detect VoIP devices and services such as SIP and H.323 protocols. By mapping the VoIP infrastructure, attackers can identify potential vulnerabilities in voice communication setups, assess the security of signaling protocols, and potentially eavesdrop on conversations.

- [Service Discovery](offensive/network/enumeration/Service Discovery/)
- [User Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/User Enumeration/)
- [Infrastructure Mapping](offensive/network/enumeration/Infrastructure Mapping/)

## Echo Enumeration
Echo services are used to verify network responses and test for firewall and routing configurations. This enumeration strategy helps in constructing a network map and identifying misconfigured services that may inadvertently expose internal network architecture.

- [Response Behavior Analysis](offensive/network/enumeration/Response Behavior Analysis/)

## Telnet Enumeration
Telnet enumeration involves capturing banner information and session details to expose vulnerable configurations. Since Telnet transmits data in plaintext, attackers can intercept credentials, identify open sessions, and exploit the lack of encryption to gain unauthorized access to systems.

- [Service Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/Service Detection/)
- [User Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/User Enumeration/)

## SMTP Enumeration
SMTP enumeration focuses on identifying server configurations, available handlers, and testing open relay settings. By enumerating valid email addresses and exploiting configurations, attackers can gather organization-related information or use the server as a spam relay.

- [Service Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/Service Detection/)
- [User Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/User Enumeration/)
- [Relay and Configuration Testing](offensive/network/enumeration/Relay and Configuration Testing/)

## LDAP Enumeration
LDAP enumeration seeks to uncover directory structures, exposed organizational units, and user information. This helps identify misconfigurations in access controls and authentication methods, enabling potential unauthorized access to sensitive directory information.

- [Service and Version Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/Service and Version Detection/)
- [Domain and Organizational Unit (OU) Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/Domain and Organizational Unit (OU) Enumeration/)
- [User and Group Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/User and Group Enumeration/)

## Kerberos Enumeration
Kerberos enumeration allows attackers to identify service principal names and gauge realm trust relationships within a network. Accurate enumeration of users and Kerberos tickets can expose weaknesses in domain configurations and account management.

- [Domain and Realm Discovery](offensive/network/enumeration/Domain and Realm Discovery/)
- [User and SPN Enumeration](offensive/network/enumeration/User and SPN Enumeration/)

## SNMP Enumeration
SNMP enumeration focuses on discovering system management information from networked devices using public and community strings. Enumerating SNMP data provides insights into system configurations, network architecture, and potential device vulnerabilities.

- [Service and Version Detection](offensive/network/enumeration/Service and Version Detection/)
- [Community String Discovery](offensive/network/enumeration/Community String Discovery/)
- [System and Network Information Gathering](offensive/network/enumeration/System and Network Information Gathering/)

## SMB Enumeration
SMB enumeration identifies exposed shared resources and service information within a Windows network. By extracting user and group data, assessing share permissions, and exploring potential misconfigurations, attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in SMB protocols for access and lateral movement.

- [Service Detection and Version](offensive/network/enumeration/Service and Version Detection/)
- [Identifying Shares](offensive/network/enumeration/Identifying Shares/)
- [Extracting User Information](offensive/network/enumeration/Extracting Users Information/)

Each enumeration type leverages specific exploits, protocols, or methods to achieve comprehensive network visibility, providing attackers with structured information for refined offensive strategies.
