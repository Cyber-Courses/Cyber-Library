## Collecting User Session Details

### Introduction to User Session Collection

User session details encompass information about active user sessions within a network. This includes data such as usernames, machine identifiers, session start times, and connected resources. The ability to collect user session details is crucial for offensive cybersecurity practitioners seeking to better understand network topology, identify potential targets, and gain insights into user behavior. Techniques for collecting session details range from simple enumeration commands to complex network packet analysis and exploitation of software vulnerabilities.

### Tools and Utilities for Session Detail Collection

#### Enumerating with `rusersd`

The `rusers` command is used to list users on remote hosts, primarily on UNIX-based systems. When accessing a system that runs the Remote Users (rusersd) daemon, an attacker can discover logged-in users by executing:

```bash
rusers hostname
```

This command can be particularly effective in environments where rusersd is still operational and not securely configured.

#### Utilizing NetBIOS and SMB Protocols

NetBIOS and the Server Message Block (SMB) protocols are often used to share resources and information within networks. Tools like `smbclient` can be used to probe these services for user session information:

```bash
smbclient -L //hostname -U username
```

This command lists shares on a server and can provide insights into user activity and session details, assuming valid credentials are available.

#### Leveraging PsExec for Remote Session Information

PsExec is a powerful tool for executing processes on remote systems. It can also be used to query user sessions when running on Windows environments:

```bash
PsExec.exe \\target -u user -p password query user
```

This command returns a list of users on the target machine, useful for identifying active sessions.

### Network Packet Analysis for Session Details

#### Capturing Packets with Wireshark

Wireshark, a widely used network protocol analyzer, allows for deep inspection of packets within a network. By capturing traffic in promiscuous mode, analysts can glean session data from observed packets:

1. Start a capture on the interface connected to the network of interest.
2. Filter the capture to focus on session-related protocols, such as SMB or Kerberos.

```plaintext
smb2.session_id
kerberos.CNameString
```

Inspecting these packets can reveal usernames, associated machines, and session identifiers.

### Interrogating Active Directory for User Sessions

#### Utilizing PowerShell for Session Queries

Active Directory environments allow for extensive PowerShell scripting to extract session details. The `Get-ADUser` and `Get-LoggedOnUser` functions can be utilized to identify current users:

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter *
Get-LoggedOnUser -ComputerName hostname
```

These commands provide vital information, such as last login times and currently logged-in accounts.

#### LDAP Enumeration for Session Data

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) can be queried to retrieve session details from directories. Using tools like `ldapsearch`, attackers can perform detailed interrogation:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -b "dc=example,dc=com" "(objectClass=user)"
```

This command extracts directory entries, including user session data, from a network.

### Leveraging Proxies and Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

#### Setting up MITM Proxies for Session Capture

Deploying MITM proxies allows attackers to intercept session data in transit. Tools such as `mitmproxy` and `Ettercap` are utilized for this purpose:

```bash
mitmproxy --mode transparent
```

By configuring the network to route traffic through the proxy, attackers can capture session information covertly.

#### Session Hijacking with DNS Spoofing

DNS spoofing techniques can redirect traffic to an attacker's controlled system, facilitating session hijacking. Combining DNS spoofing with a MITM setup allows for session detail collection without an adversary's presence being apparent to users.

### Advanced Tactics for Session Detail Collection

#### Exploiting Protocol Vulnerabilities

Certain protocols may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to extract session information. For example, legacy protocols like Telnet can be attacked to retrieve cleartext login credentials, which may reveal session dynamics.

#### Custom Scripting for Automated Collection

Automation simplifies the collection of session details across multiple hosts. Custom scripts, written in languages like Python or Bash, can automate the execution of network queries and the extraction of session data:

```python
import paramiko
# A script to gather session details over SSH
def collect_sessions(host, username, password):
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    ssh.connect(host, username=username, password=password)
    stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command('who')
    print(stdout.read())
    ssh.close()
```

This Python script leverages the Paramiko library to automate session term details retrieval over SSH.

### Evasion Techniques and Stealth Operations

#### Avoiding Detection by Network Monitoring Tools

Detection evasion requires careful planning, such as utilizing encrypted tunnels (e.g., SSH tunneling) and avoiding signature-based detection mechanisms. This is crucial when collecting user session details to minimize the risk of detection.

#### Using Encrypted Channels for Data Exfiltration

Encrypting the data collection process ensures that even if traffic is monitored, the content remains unintelligible to network defenders. For example, using OpenSSL, one can tunnel sensitive queries over an encrypted connection:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect target:443
```

This command establishes a secure connection to the target server, ensuring collected session details remain private.

### Post-Collection Analysis and Utilization

#### Integrating Collected Data into Further Attacks

The data collected from user sessions can guide future activities, such as spear-phishing campaigns or lateral movement within the network. Understanding user patterns and behavior is critical in crafting effective attacks.

#### Prioritizing Targets Based on Session Information

Analyzing session details allows for identifying high-value targets, such as users with escalated privileges or access to sensitive systems. By understanding the session context, attackers can prioritize targets effectively, focusing efforts on achieving the most significant impact within the network.
