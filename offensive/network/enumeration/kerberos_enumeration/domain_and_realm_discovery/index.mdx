# Domain and Realm Discovery

## Enumerating Kerberos Realm Information

### Tools and Techniques for Realm Identification

Kerberos realm identification is crucial in understanding the security boundaries of a network. Tools like `nmap` with custom scripts can be employed to discover Kerberos realms. Command execution might look like:

```shell
nmap --script krb5-enum-users -p 88 [TARGET-IP]
```

Advanced scripting and tools, such as `kerbrute`, provide automated processes to enumerate and validate realm and principal information. 

```shell
kerbrute -user [USERNAME] -pass [PASSWORD] [REALM]
```

### Analyzing DNS TXT Records for Kerberos Realm Information

DNS TXT records often hold critical information for Kerberos realm verification. Network security tools can parse these records and present information on realm configurations. Use `dig` or `nslookup` tools to retrieve these records:

```shell
dig TXT _kerberos.example.com
```

Interpreting the realm data requires understanding Kerberos ticket and DNS structuring, where realm information guides service ticket requests.

### Extraction and Enumeration via LDAP Queries

LDAP queries are another method for discovering Kerberos realms and their structures. They provide a directory-based approach to analyze user attributes related to Kerberos.

```shell
ldapsearch -x -h [DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] -D "[BIND DN]" -w "[PASSWORD]" -b "[BASE DN]" "(objectclass=krbRealm)"
```

Parsing LDAP responses necessitates comprehension of LDAP schemas and how Kerberos interfaces within these schemas. Proper query crafting can reveal extensive details about realm hierarchies and relationships.

### Exploiting Realm Trust Relationships

Realms often establish trust with other realms, facilitating cross-realm authentication processes. Identifying such trusted relationships involves mapping known realm data with possible trust candidates. Tools developed for cross-realm attacks can analyze and exploit these trust relationships.

Understanding trust relationships helps in replicating or forging tickets across realms, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

## Mapping Domain Controllers and KDCs

### Identifying Domain Controller Hosts within a Network

Domain controllers are critical components of a network's authentication infrastructure. Detection can involve network scanning tools like `nmap`, focusing on LDAP, SMB, and other domain servicing ports.

```shell
nmap -p 389,135,445 --script smb-enum-shares [TARGET-NETWORK]
```

Analyzing network response signatures helps to determine a machine's role as a domain controller. 

### Detecting Key Distribution Centers (KDC) Configuration

The Key Distribution Center (KDC) plays a vital role in the Kerberos authentication process. Proper identification gravely affects attack surface understanding. Using network traffic analysis tools, distinctions between a standard domain controller and a KDC are made, primarily through the examination of traffic on port 88.

Monitoring tools that log Kerberos traffic offer insights into the configuration of these systems beyond typical network scans.

### Domain Controller Reconnaissance Techniques

Reconnaissance of domain controllers is crucial to map out their roles and service integrations within a domain. Metadata collection includes gathering information on Active Directory roles, Group Policy settings, and service records. Techniques may include analyzing LDAP and SMB traffic. 

Traffic patterns, active directory queries, and metadata inspection are vital for effective mapping, offering key insights into potential avenues for exploitation.
