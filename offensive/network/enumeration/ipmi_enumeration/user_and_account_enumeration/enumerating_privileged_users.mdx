# Enumerating Privileged Users

In the landscape of offensive cybersecurity, identifying privileged users within a network is a critical component of a successful enumeration phase. Privileged users often have elevated permissions that, if compromised, can lead to catastrophic breaches within an organization's infrastructure. This article focuses on the techniques and tools used to identify these accounts effectively.

## Advanced Enumeration Tools and Techniques

### Nmap NSE Scripts for Privilege Detection

Nmap offers a robust scripting engine (NSE) that can be utilized to automate the detection of privileged accounts within a target network. By employing scripts specifically tailored for identifying elevated permissions, such as those targeting SMB or LDAP services, an attacker can glean valuable information about user roles and privileges.

Example Command:
```bash
nmap --script smb-enum-users -p445 <target IP>
```

This command uses the `smb-enum-users` script to list SMB users on the target host, potentially revealing those with administrative privileges.

### Automated Tools for Privileged Account Discovery

Automated tools such as Metasploit or standalone utilities like `GetUserSPNs.py` are essential for large-scale operations. These tools efficiently discover accounts with privilege escalation paths, such as those that are vulnerable to Kerberoasting attacks.

Example Command:
```bash
python GetUserSPNs.py domain/user -spn HTTP -dc-ip <domain controller IP>
```

This script looks for service principal names (SPNs) associated with privileged accounts, which can be indicative of potential misconfigurations.

## Credential Harvesting and Analysis

### Password Spraying and Brute Force

Password spraying is a method where common passwords are tested across a large number of accounts, allowing attackers to avoid account lockout policies. Brute force attacks are more targeted, often automating the process with tools like Hydra or CrackMapExec.

Example Command using Hydra:
```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt <target IP> smb
```

This attempts to brute force SMB credentials with usernames and passwords from the respective files.

### Analyzing Credential Reuse and Misconfigurations

Analysis of credential reuse can highlight weaknesses where privileged credentials are used across multiple services. Tools such as BloodHound can be leveraged to map privilege escalation paths and potential misconfigurations within an Active Directory environment.

Example Command:
```bash
bloodhound-python -c All -d <domain> -u <user> -p <password> -dc <domain controller IP>
```

This populates BloodHound with data about domain users, helping identify misconfigurations and credential reuse patterns.

## Leveraging Protocols and Services for Privileged Enumeration

### SMB Protocol and LDAP Queries

SMB and LDAP are commonly used protocols that can be queried to enumerate domain users, including those with administrative privileges. Enum4linux is a versatile tool for such queries.

Example Command:
```bash
enum4linux -a <target IP>
```

This command scans a target host for available SMB and NetBIOS information, including potential administrative accounts.

### RPC and WMI Queries

Within Windows networks, RPC and WMI are instrumental in gathering information about user privileges. Tools such as `rpcclient` and WMIC are used to automate these queries.

Example RPCclient Command:
```bash
rpcclient <target IP> -U ""%""
```

This opens an interactive shell to enumerate users and groups, useful for identifying those with elevated access rights.

## Attack Surface Expansion Through Service Exploitation

### Harvesting Privileged Users via Misconfigured Services

Exploiting misconfigured services is a direct method to expose privileged users. Metasploit can be configured to automate these processes, targeting known vulnerabilities that reveal user roles or credentials.

Example Command:
```bash
msfconsole -q -x "use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumusers; set RHOSTS <target IP>; run"
```

This Metasploit auxiliary module enumerates SMB users, aiding in the identification of those with elevated privileges.

### Zero-Trust Vulnerabilities and Privileged Access

Exploiting OAuth and SAML authentication frameworks can expose privileged access, especially in cloud environments. Harvested tokens can be leveraged for privilege escalation effectively.

## Cross-Domain Privileged Account Enumeration

### Interactive Domain Trusts Analysis

Mapping domain trusts can reveal cross-domain privileges, with tools like `TrustEnum` supporting this type of analysis. This is particularly relevant in environments with multiple domains or forests.

### Inter-Forest Privileged User Discovery

Techniques for cross-domain analysis, such as Kerberos ticket-based attacks, allow attackers to enumerate privileged users across different domains, extending the potential attack surface.

### Cross-Domain Kerberos Silver and Golden Ticket Attacks

Utilizing advanced Kerberos attacks, including Silver and Golden Ticket forgeries, attackers can impersonate privileged users or access resources cross-domain.

## Maintaining Persistence

### Backdooring Privileged Accounts

Maintaining persistence through compromised privileged accounts involves manipulating registry settings or creating scheduled tasks that ensure continued access even after remediation attempts.

### Advanced Credential Theft

Mimikatz is a leading tool for credentials extraction, directly targeting systems' memory to extract usernames and passwords of privileged users, which can then be used to establish command and control.

```bash
mimikatz.exe
```

Within the Mimikatz console, executing the `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` command retrieves cached credentials, providing the necessary data for a broader breach.

By understanding and utilizing these techniques, offensive security professionals can effectively enumerate and exploit privileged users within diverse network environments. Each method presents unique insights into user roles, system misconfigurations, and potential avenues for unauthorized access, heightening the operational effectiveness of an attack strategy.
