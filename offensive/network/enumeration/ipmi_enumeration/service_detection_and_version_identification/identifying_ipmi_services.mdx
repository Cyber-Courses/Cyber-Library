# Identifying IPMI Services

## Overview of IPMI

IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is a standardized interface that allows for remote management and monitoring of servers even when they are turned off or unresponsive. This functionality is provided through a combination of hardware modules and specialized firmware embedded within the serverâ€™s motherboard. IPMI grants administrators the capability to perform diagnostics, monitor hardware status, and manage the server through a network connection, which is essential for maintaining large-scale enterprise environments. Understanding IPMI's foundational role in server management is crucial for identifying its network services during offensive security assessments.

## Initial IPMI Service Detection

The detection of IPMI services on a network is primarily executed through network scanning techniques aimed at pinpointing the standard ports associated with IPMI operations. IPMI typically operates over known ports such as 623/UDP, 623/TCP, 664/UDP, and 664/TCP. Utilizing Nmap, a premier network scanning tool, is the first step in identifying these services. By executing port scans, an attacker can determine the presence of the IPMI protocol on target hosts by checking for responses on these ports. An example Nmap command for detecting IPMI services is:

```
nmap -p 623,664 <target_ip> --script ipmi-discover
```

This command instructs Nmap to specifically check for open ports commonly associated with IPMI and to apply the `ipmi-discover` script, which can provide further insights into discovered services.

## Network Scanning Tools and Techniques

Beyond Nmap, alternative tools such as Masscan can be employed for rapid scanning of larger address spaces due to its ability to send and receive packets asynchronously. When using Masscan, the syntax is akin to Nmap but tailored for speed-optimized execution:

```
masscan <target_cidr> -p 623,664 --rate=10000
```

This command will scan the specified CIDR network block for IPMI typical ports at a specified rate, allowing for speedy detection across vast sectors of a network.

## Verifying IPMI Service Presence

Once potential IPMI services are identified through scanning, confirmation is essential. Verification can be achieved through banner grabbing, which involves connecting to the service to read its preliminary banner response. Simple command-line tools like netcat or telnet can serve this purpose:

```
nc -v <target_ip> 623
```

This netcat command is used to establish a connection to the target IP on port 623, displaying any banners returned by the service. Additionally, Metasploit Framework contains auxiliary modules such as `auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version` that can further assist in service verification by interacting directly with the IPMI protocol to ascertain more detailed service information.

## Advanced IPMI Service Fingerprinting

For more granular analysis, dedicated tools like IPMItool can be utilized to interrogate discovered IPMI services for their characteristics directly. IPMItool can interface with a server's Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) to extract detailed service features. A common command for executing this is:

```
ipmitool -I lanplus -H <target_ip> -U admin -P password chassis status
```

This command uses IPMItool to connect over LAN protocol in a secure manner, querying the chassis status to determine operational details of the BMC and IPMI service.

## Analysis of Network Traffic

Analysis of IPMI-related traffic with Wireshark can provide insights into how these protocols function and identify unique traits. Filtering for IPMI-specific traffic in Wireshark can be done through:

```
ipmi
```

This filter command will isolate and display any packets that utilize the IPMI protocol, highlighting communication exchanges between a management console and the server's BMC. Observing these interactions allows for the deduction of the server's IPMI utilization and potentially vulnerable configurations.

## Bypassing Network Security Controls

When IPMI services are safeguarded behind firewalls or intrusion detection systems, evasive techniques may be required to uncover them. Methods such as fragmented scanning, which involves sending out-of-order or fragmented packet sequences, can slip past certain firewall rules. Tools that support these techniques, like Nmap with the fragment option, are instrumental:

```
nmap -f -p 623,664 <target_ip> --script ipmi-discover
```

This advanced scanning technique allows security professionals to bypass simple packet filters and firewalls designed to block standard scanning patterns, thereby uncovering IPMI services that may be inadvertently exposed.

By following these systematic approaches, offensive security practitioners can accurately detect, confirm, and analyze IPMI services within any organization's network infrastructure, allowing for a thorough assessment of potential vulnerabilities relating to server management interfaces.
