# Identifying NFS Services on Network

## Network Scanning for NFS Presence

Network scanning is a critical initial step in identifying Network File System (NFS) services on a network. The process typically begins by probing the network to identify active IP addresses which might host NFS services. This can be accomplished using tools like Nmap, Zmap, or Masscan, which allow for efficient detection of active devices.

Once active IPs are identified, port scanning is employed to specifically detect open ports that are indicative of NFS services. The default port for NFS is 2049, and scanning tools can be configured to target this port exclusively, thus narrowing down potential NFS hosts. A simple Nmap command to achieve this could be:

```bash
nmap -p 2049 <target-IP-range>
```

This command scans a specified IP range for devices with port 2049 open, directly indicating potential NFS servers. This step sets the groundwork for further interrogation of identified services to confirm and assess NFS functionality.

## Service Enumeration Tactics

Once potential NFS services are identified via open port diagnostics, advanced service enumeration techniques are employed to verify the services bound to these ports. This involves more in-depth interaction with the target system to accurately identify the service type and any accompanying versions.

Enumeration tools that support RPC services, such as rpcinfo or Rpcclient, can be utilized to enumerate services running on NFS-related ports. An example command might look like:

```bash
rpcinfo -p <target-IP>
```

This command provides a list of all RPC services running on the target, including their respective port numbers, program numbers, and versions. The output can confirm whether NFS is running and which versions may be active, enabling deeper analysis of the target's service capabilities.

## Banner Grabbing Techniques

Banner grabbing is a technique utilized to extract information about services running on open network ports. For NFS, this can involve querying the service to retrieve its banner, which often includes version information or may expose unexpected details like configuration snippets or potential vulnerabilities.

Tools like Netcat or Telnet can be co-opted to accomplish banner grabbing. Using Netcat, one might issue the following command:

```bash
nc -v -n <target-IP> 2049
```

This command attempts to connect to the NFS port on the target, with the expectation that any returned banner information will include details about the service. By analyzing captured banners, attackers can tailor further exploits based on identified software versions or configurations.

## RPC Portmapper Enumeration

RPC Portmapper is a pivotal service used by NFS to map RPC program numbers to network port numbers. Enumerating this service provides insight into which RPC-based services are active on a given host, potentially exposing command and control capabilities.

Using rpcinfo, one can query the portmapper for all services, aiding in the identification of not just NFS processes, but also other services that might be of interest:

```bash
rpcinfo -p <target-IP>
```

The output from this command will include a list of all RPC services, along with their program numbers, versions, and bound ports. This enumeration can reveal additional services that may widen the attack surface if exploited.

## Automated Detection Tools

In pursuit of efficiency and scalability, automated tools are critical in detecting NFS services across large networks. These tools are designed to autonomously discover NFS hosts, query RPC services, perform banner grabbing, and sometimes even identify known vulnerabilities.

Examples of such tools include Nmap with its NSE scripts tailored for NFS and RPC enumeration, or specialized NFS enumeration tools like nfsenum. Integrating such automation into larger offensive operations allows for rapid and comprehensive service detection:

```bash
nmap --script nfs* -p 2049 <target-IP>
```

This command uses Nmap's scripting engine to engage all scripts related to NFS, executing comprehensive checks for NFS service presence and related vulnerabilities. By leveraging automated tools, attackers enhance their ability to detect NFS services while maintaining cover across large networks.
