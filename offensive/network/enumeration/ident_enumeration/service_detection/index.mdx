# Service Detection in Ident Enumeration

## [Identifying Open Ident Services (Port 113)](offensive/network/enumeration/ident_enumeration/service_detection/identifying_open_ident_services_port_113)

### Scanning Techniques for Port 113
Port 113 is typically used by Ident services to report back information, such as the identity of the user who is initiating a network connection. To detect open Ident services effectively, offensive cybersecurity professionals often employ various scanning techniques.

**Advanced Nmap Scanning**:  
Nmap is a versatile tool that allows for multiple types of scans. A common technique involves using a TCP SYN scan on port 113 to ascertain which hosts are listening. The command for a basic TCP SYN scan on port 113 looks like this:

```bash
nmap -sS -p 113 <target-ip>
```

Incorporating service version detection allows for deeper insight:

```bash
nmap -sV -p 113 <target-ip>
```

**Masscan for Large Networks**:  
When dealing with large networks, Masscan provides a high-speed alternative. It can scan the entirety of IPv4 space, reporting back open ports such as 113:

```bash
masscan -p113 <network-range> --rate 1000
```

**Scripting with Python for Tailored Probing**:  
Python scripts allow for customization in probing Ident services, giving flexibility in how requests are constructed and analyzed.

### Credentialed vs Uncredentialed Detection
Distinction between scans performed with credentials versus those without can provide varied levels of insight and response.

**Leveraging Credentialed Scans for Better Insight**:  
Credentialed scans involve using authenticated access to probe the Ident service, yielding more detailed information. This might require previously acquired access credentials.

**Analyzing Uncredentialed Scan Results with Precision**:  
Uncredentialed scans rely solely on the information returned from open services without credentials. Analysis hinges on interpreting default responses accurately.

### Bypassing Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems
To reach Ident services behind firewalls and IDS, evasion techniques are vital.

**Port Knocking Techniques**:  
This involves initiating a sequence of port connections designed to open a particular port, such as 113.

**Crafting Custom Packet Payloads**:  
Customizing packet payloads can disguise scan traffic to appear benign.

**Utilizing Fragmented Packets to Avoid Detection**:  
Fragmenting packets can disrupt deep packet inspection, aiding in evading detection systems.

## [Determining Ident Server Implementations](offensive/network/enumeration/ident_enumeration/service_detection/determining_ident_server_implementations)

### Enumeration of Ident Daemons
Ident servers can be numerous and varied.

**Use of Custom Scripts for Identification**:  
Scripts can automate the identification of Ident servers by polling with specific queries.

**Profiling Common Ident Server Banner Output**:  
Banner grabbing is an effective way to identify the server implementation of open Ident services. Often, the banner can include software version and operating system details.

### Fingerprinting Techniques
Identifying the specific implementation and version of an Ident server requires advanced fingerprinting methods.

**Crafting ICP Packets for Server Response Analysis**:  
Interpreting responses from crafted ICP packets can indicate specific server characteristics.

**Utilization of Operating System-Level Detectors**:  
Using techniques and tools that can determine the associated OS can give clues to Ident server implementations.

**Timing Analysis for Indirect Identification**:  
Timing how long different servers take to respond can inadvertently provide identification clues via systematic delays.

### Assessing Ident Server Configurations
Configurations often indicate if an Ident service can be exploited.

**Querying for Default and Misconfigured Settings**:  
Identifying servers with default or weak configurations can point to potential vulnerabilities.

**Cross-Referencing Ident Metadata with Known Vulnerabilities**:  
Once metadata is gathered, it can be cross-referenced with databases of known vulnerabilities to identify security weaknesses.

### Automated Tools and Scripts
Automation is key for efficiency in large engagements.

**Review and Deployment of Tools like Netcat and Socat**:  
Tools like Netcat can be utilized for creating raw connections, while Socat can handle more complicated scenarios involving proxies and multiple protocols.

**Developing Custom Bash or Python Scripts to Automate Detection Procedures**:  
Custom scripting can allow for repetitive tasks to be performed seamlessly, facilitating continuous and automated enumeration of Ident services.
