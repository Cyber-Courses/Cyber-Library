# Identifying Open Ident Services (Port 113)

## Introduction to Ident Protocol on Port 113

The Ident protocol, defined in RFC 1413, serves a crucial role in identifying network users. Operating over Port 113, it allows systems to query a remote server for information about the owner of a specific TCP connection. Essentially, the Ident service returns the username associated with a particular network connection, providing insights into who initiated a certain connection on a specific machine. This is particularly useful for server administrators intending to track the origin of a connection in scenarios such as multiple users accessing shared systems.

## Strategic Importance for Offensive Operators

For offensive security practitioners, identifying open Ident services can serve multiple strategic goals. Firstly, it aids in constructing an outline of the network's architecture by identifying which systems are providing user identification services. Additionally, Ident responses can unveil relationships and potential trust structures between systems, informing threat models, and highlighting attack pathways. This capability makes open Ident services a valuable asset, potentially revealing internal aspects of network operations and setting the stage for informed enumeration and further investigation.

## Tools for Ident Service Detection

### Leveraging Nmap for Ident Service Detection

Nmap is a versatile network scanner that includes capabilities for detecting Ident services. The `identd-info.nse` script is a specific tool within Nmap's toolkit, designed to interact with Ident services to determine the software running and capture pertinent information. Operators can use the script through the following command:

```bash
nmap --script=identd-info.nse -p 113 <target_ip>
```

This command scans the target IP, specifically probing Port 113 for an Ident response, effectively revealing the presence and nature of Ident services available.

### Alternative Tools and Techniques

Apart from Nmap, various other tools can perform Ident service detection. Telnet or Netcat can directly interface with Port 113, manually querying the service:

```bash
telnet <target_ip> 113
```

or alternatively using Netcat:

```bash
echo "0, 113" | nc <target_ip> 113
```

These commands provide a raw interface to manually send Ident queries and read responses, offering flexibility in testing and validation. Additionally, scripted solutions or automation scripts can streamline this process, allowing for identification across numerous hosts and ports more efficiently.

## Advanced Identification Methodologies

### TCP Half-Open Scanning Techniques

Employing half-open scanning techniques can be beneficial in environments where stealth is paramount. TCP SYN scanning, where the full handshake is not completed, can identify open Ident services with reduced risk of detection:

```bash
nmap -sS -p 113 <target_ip>
```

This scan checks if Port 113 is open without completing the final ACK, thereby minimizing the likelihood that the probing will be logged by monitoring systems.

### Application-layer Fingerprinting

Application-layer fingerprinting goes beyond simple IDENT detection, discerning the specifics of the Ident service implementation. By crafting and sending unique queries, operators can determine specific software variants or versions running the service, mapping their quirks and peculiarities.

## Enumeration Post-Identification

Once Ident services are identified, further enumeration can proceed by extracting detailed user and session data from observable responses. Each ident query may yield information pertaining to active network sessions and logged-in users. Cross-referencing these responses with other network data allows practitioners to map active connections, probe security policies, and infer session-specific data, leading to potential lateral movement pathways.

## Mitigation and Evasion Techniques

For penetration testers, understanding how to evade potential obstacles is pivotal. When firewalls or IDS/IPS systems may filter or detect Ident requests, alternative techniques may be necessary. This could involve employing proxy servers or leveraging compromised intermediate hosts to obscure the origination of requests. Offensively creative techniques could involve sending innocuous queries under common SID codes to avoid raising alarms.

## Assessment of Risk and Exploitation Potential

The exposure of Ident responses constitutes a noteworthy security risk, potentially furnishing adversaries with useful reconnaissance data. However, the actual exploitation framework heavily depends on overall security configurations and how other services on the network are secured. Offensive operators need to integrate Ident data decisively with wider attack strategies aimed at lateral movement or privilege escalation.

## Continual Monitoring and Verification

Maintaining constant awareness of Ident service activity through automated monitoring setups is critical in ensuring network security comprehensively. This process entails deploying surveillance scripts and alerts to flag new or altered Ident service instances, ensuring no unintended exposure or configuration drift occurs, thereby safeguarding the network architecture proactively.
