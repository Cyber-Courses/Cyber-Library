# Identifying Open Ident Services (Port 113)

## Understanding Ident Protocols

### Protocol Basics and Relevance
The Ident protocol, short for Identification, was originally designed to map connections to user accounts as defined on multi-user Unix systems. It operates using a simple query-response mechanism over TCP, typically on Port 113. Despite being an older protocol, it remains relevant in certain legacy systems and environments where user identification can provide additional logging or access control information.

The Ident protocol's relevance in modern networks primarily hinges on identification and logging features, making it a target for attackers to gather intelligence on potential users associated with a network service. The information gleaned from an Ident service can help attackers tailor their attack vectors by understanding the context of connections on a target system.

### How Ident Services Operate
Ident services respond to queries requesting identification of a user on a specified port. A typical query specifies the server’s local port and the remote client's port, and in return, the server provides a simple text-based response indicating the associated username. This operating mechanism is straightforward, with the Ident service acting as a middle layer between incoming requests and user information.

Port 113 is reserved for Ident services to facilitate these operations. The protocol’s simplicity allows for rapid identification, but it also provides minimal security, notoriously communicating in plaintext. This lack of encryption and authentication makes queries and their responses susceptible to interception and misuse by malicious actors looking to exploit exposed systems.

## Techniques for Identifying Open Ident Services

### Port Scanning Methods
Port scanning remains a fundamental technique for identifying open Ident services. Tools such as Nmap can be essential in detecting whether Port 113 is open on target systems. A typical Nmap command for scanning Port 113 might look like:

```bash
nmap -p 113 target_ip
```

This command specifically targets Port 113, querying whether it is active and potentially hosting an Ident service. Due to Ident's minimal footprint, scans are usually fast, though network administrators may restrict this port due to its known vulnerabilities.

### Fingerprinting Ident Ports
Effective use of fingerprinting involves attempting to distinguish Ident services from other open services on similar ports. This can be achieved by using banner grabbing techniques where the query is sent to the port to elicit a response. Tools like Netcat can facilitate this process with simple command-line operations:

```bash
echo "113, target_port" | nc target_ip 113
```

By analyzing the server’s response time and content, it's possible to determine whether a service is merely mirroring output or providing genuine Ident response data. The consistency of responses aids in verifying the presence of an Ident service.

## Tools for Ident Enumeration

### Specialized Ident Enumeration Tools
Several tools are specifically designed for Ident enumeration, offering streamlined approaches to handle Ident service enumeration. For instance, tools like Idlescan and custom Python scripts exist to automate queries and parse Ident responses, providing structured output for review.

The strength of these tools lies in their ability to automate the enumeration process across multiple hosts, allowing for batch scanning with minimal user intervention, while their primary limitation is often the environment's defensive measures, which can impede full enumeration efforts.

### Integration with Network Scanners
Network scanning tools such as Masscan and Zmap can be configured to include Ident service checks within broader network scans, allowing simultaneous identification of multiple services. This integration can be achieved by configuring custom scan scripts or modules specific to Ident ports:

```bash
masscan target_ip -p 113 --rate=1000
```

Automated scripts can further enhance this process by chaining Ident queries with log analysis, building an association profile quickly.

## Bypassing Common Restrictions

### Avoiding Firewall Interference
Firewalls are the first line of defense in protecting network services, often configured to restrict access to known vulnerable ports like 113. Subverting these restrictions might involve utilizing techniques that mask Ident service probing as legitimate traffic, such as scanning from trusted IPs or employing port-knocking to trigger remote port openings only when specific signals are detected.

Proxy manipulation and obfuscation strategies can help circumvent static firewall rules. By leveraging these methods, attackers can gain insights into otherwise protected Ident services.

### Evading Intrusion Detection Systems
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can often be triggered by routine Ident enumeration attempts. Crafting queries that mimic legitimate traffic patterns, leveraging low-frequency interrogation techniques, and utilizing encrypted channels can all serve to bypass detection thresholds.

For instance, intentionally pausing between queries and using randomized source ports can reduce the likelihood of detection by signature-based IDS. Combining these with legitimate-looking requests further mitigates the chance an IDS will escalate an alert to administrators.

## Strategic Execution in a Penetration Test

### Prioritizing Ident Service Checks
Ident service checks should be prioritized in environments where legacy systems are present or where verbose logging is expected. Identifying such services can provide insights into active user sessions that may prove advantageous in furthering penetration test objectives. During an assessment, timing Ident service checks to align with observed peak activity can increase the probability of obtaining valuable user identification data.

### Assessing Ident Service Vulnerabilities
The identified services may reveal vulnerabilities that can be leveraged throughout a penetration test. These include poor implementation of TCP wrappers, allowing spoofed queries, lack of encrypted communication, and incorrect user data disclosure. Additionally, discovered usernames can facilitate credential-based attacks or reconnaissance efforts, providing substantial footholds for lateral movement within a compromised network.

By systematically targeting and enumerating Ident services on Port 113, penetration testers can uncover significant insights into user mappings and potential vulnerabilities, thus leveraging these findings to conduct further attacks or enhance the efficacy of their strategy.
