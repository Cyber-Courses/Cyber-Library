# Determining Cassandra Version and Features

## Service Banner Grabbing

Banner grabbing involves connecting to a service to extract version information from response headers. This technique is useful when dealing with services like Cassandra, where version information can be revealed in the initial handshake.

### Utilize Telnet and Netcat for Banner Grabbing

Telnet and Netcat are both simple command-line utilities that can be used to manually connect to a Cassandra service and potentially extract version information.

- **Telnet Command Example**:
  ```bash
  telnet <Cassandra-Host> 9042
  ```
  This will connect to the default Cassandra native protocol port. Upon connection, any service-specific response banners, potentially containing version information, will be displayed.

- **Netcat Command Example**:
  ```bash
  nc <Cassandra-Host> 9042
  ```
  Similar to Telnet, Netcat can provide raw access to the service. Note that raw output must be observed closely for version clues.

### Employ OpenSSL for Secure Connection Banners

For Cassandra instances using TLS, OpenSSL can be leveraged to initiate a secure connection and inspect potential handshake messages.

- **OpenSSL Command Example**:
  ```bash
  openssl s_client -connect <Cassandra-Host>:9042
  ```
  This command attempts to establish an SSL connection, which may reveal version information in server certificates or initial greeting responses.

## Protocol-Specific Queries

By crafting specific requests that align with the Cassandra Protocol or Query Language (CQL), it's possible to elicit detailed version and feature responses.

### Craft Native Protocol Handshake Requests

Understanding and employing Cassandra's native protocol can lead to version identification. Craft requests that facilitate handshake protocols, analyzing responses for version indicators.

- Crafting these requests requires in-depth understanding of Cassandra’s native protocol. Custom scripts or tools that mimic these handshake requests can automate extraction.

### Leverage CQL (Cassandra Query Language) Features

Executing specific queries directly untiling CQL can extract version data directly from Cassandra systems tables.

- **CQLSH Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT release_version, cql_version FROM system.local;
  ```
  This query retrieves version information directly from the system-local table, specifically targeting release and CQL versions installed on Cassandra nodes.

## Automated Version Detection Tools

Employing automated tools facilitates efficient extraction of version information without manual interaction.

### Utilize Nmap with Cassandra Scripts

Nmap’s scripting engine includes scripts specifically designed for protocol detection, including Cassandra.

- **Nmap Command Example**:
  ```bash
  nmap -p 9042 --script cassandra-info <Cassandra-Host>
  ```
  This command scans the Cassandra default port for direct version information using specialized scripts.

### Incorporate Python Libraries for Comprehensive Detection

Python with libraries such as `pycassa` or the native Cassandra driver can facilitate programmatic querying of version information.

- **Sample Python Script Using Cassandra Driver**:
  ```python
  from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

  cluster = Cluster(['<Cassandra-Host>'])
  session = cluster.connect()
  rows = session.execute("SELECT release_version FROM system.local")
  for row in rows:
      print(row.release_version)
  ```
  This Python script connects to a Cassandra node and retrieves the release version using the system's local table.

## Dependency and Configuration File Analysis

Another approach is directly reading through configuration and dependency files likely present on systems where Cassandra is installed to gain insight into installed versions and features.

### Inspect Dependency Metadata in Configuration Files

Configuration files often contain comments and metadata detailing the installed version.

- Search through files such as `cassandra.yaml` for any version references and document comments for enabled features.

### Access and Analyze configuration.yaml Files

The `configuration.yaml` file may also contain contributing version information and enabled features.

- Look for key indicators or commented versions that lay out specific settings and enabled features unique to certain versions.

### Evaluate Host Software Packaging System

Software package management systems can reveal versioning details based on the package metadata.

- Investigate package management systems like `dpkg`, `rpm`, or `yum` to query installed Cassandra package details that could contain version specifics.

## Cross-Version Features and Exploits

Exploring cross-version discrepancies helps identify pathways for potential exploits based on version-specific vulnerabilities.

### Identify Deprecated and Unsupported Features

Older Cassandra versions retain deprecated features posing security risks.

- Determine these legacy features that are removed or modified in newer updates, which might offer exploitation paths unique to older versions.

### Track Known Vulnerabilities and Exploits by Version

Keeping track of vulnerabilities across Cassandra versions allows for strategic exploitation planning.

- Use databases like CVE and exploit documentation to map vulnerabilities to the corresponding versions. This examination supports tailored exploitation strategies and vulnerability assessments.
