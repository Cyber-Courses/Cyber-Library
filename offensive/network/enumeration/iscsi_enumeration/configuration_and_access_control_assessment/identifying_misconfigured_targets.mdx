# Identifying Misconfigured Targets

## Systematic Identification of ISCSI Targets

ISCSI (Internet Small Computer Systems Interface) targets are storage resources located on a network that can be accessed by initiators using the iSCSI protocol. Identifying such targets is a crucial step in assessing their configuration and potential misconfigurations. The range of techniques used for uncovering iSCSI target identifiers includes network scanning and enumeration.

Network scanning tools, such as `nmap`, are instrumental in discovering iSCSI targets. By scanning for open iSCSI ports, typically port 3260, one can identify potential targets on a network. A command example might be:

```shell
nmap -p 3260 --script iscsi-info <target IP range>
```

This scan uses the `iscsi-info` script to obtain detailed information about active iSCSI targets, such as their unique identifiers or IQNs (iSCSI Qualified Names).

## Analyzing ISCSI Discovery Protocols

The iSCSI discovery protocols provide mechanisms for an initiator to discover the addresses, names, and portals of iSCSI targets. Offensive professionals exploit these discovery mechanisms to gain insights into target configurations, identifying potential weaknesses. 

Standard discovery mechanisms involve logging into iSCSI portals and intercepting responses that help identify targets. Observing iSCSI target response patterns can shed light on configuration details. Tools like Wireshark could be employed to capture packets during iSCSI discovery, enabling analysts to parse the data and reveal misconfigured settings.

## Evaluating Target Access Controls

Access control evaluation involves scrutinizing iSCSI target configurations to detect authentication weaknesses. Analysts assess whether targets require authentication, use defaults, or lack security.

Basic evaluations might reveal targets accepting zero authentication setup or utilizing weak passwords. Discovering targets with default credentials is a prime offensive opportunity. Testing various combinations of default and weak passwords against identified iSCSI ports helps in evaluating the robustness of access controls. Tools like `hydra` or `medusa` can facilitate these attempts:

```shell
hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt <target IP> iscsi-login
```

## Misconfiguration Exploitation Techniques

Exploiting misconfigured iSCSI targets often involves leveraging unsecured configurations. If authentication is bypassable or non-existent, it opens doors to engaging with the target directly, potentially interacting with and manipulating stored data.

Using iSCSI enumeration scripts, such as `iscsiadm`, allows for scripting automated target assessments. These scripts can test targets iteratively, searching for misconfiguration indicators, and expanding the offensive capabilities of security teams.

## Incident Response Evasion

Once a target is identified and accessed, maintaining a low profile to evade detection becomes critical. Tactics for minimizing detection include reducing network footprint and altering engagement periods. Timing access to coincide with high network traffic times can help blend iSCSI access signals.

Moreover, covering tracks — such as clearing logs post access and deploying proxy mechanisms — supports remaining clandestine during target assessment.

## Continuous Monitoring for Misconfigurations

Continuous monitoring for iSCSI misconfigurations is essential for staying abreast of potential vulnerabilities. This involves deploying automated tools that track changes in configuration and access settings regularly. Implementing periodic audits to review these configurations ensures that security postures remain robust against evolving threats.

Automated solutions like SIEM systems provide real-time alerts and insights into anomalous activities, helping operators to react swiftly to security incidents involving iSCSI targets.

## Engaging in Controlled Exploitation and Pivoting

Engaging with an identified target requires discerning controlled exploitation, ensuring the environment’s integrity remains uncompromised. Testing weaknesses, once identified, allows for an understanding of the broader implications on network security.

Furthermore, successfully exploiting misconfigured iSCSI targets opens up possibilities for network pivoting, offering deeper insights into lateral movement opportunities within the target network. Controlled testing and exploration ensure offensive cybersecurity assessments are thorough, practical, and secure.
