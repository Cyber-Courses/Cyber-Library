### Discovering Initiator and Target Credentials

#### Credential Harvesting Techniques

**Network Sniffing for Credentials**

Monitoring iSCSI traffic can reveal critical authentication credentials when communication is not properly secured. Tools like Wireshark and tcpdump allow practitioners to capture network packets and analyze them for sensitive information. These tools can inspect iSCSI authentication exchanges by capturing packets on the network interface connected to the iSCSI network. During this process, an attacker seeks to intercept the Initial Connection Request Message (ICRM) that contains an iSCSI Initiator Name (IQN) and, possibly, hashed passwords or keys used in CHAP authentication. 

Using a tool like Wireshark:
- Launch Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface.
- Filter for `iscsi` traffic using the display filter.
- Analyze the captured packets to extract iSCSI names or potential username/password data from ISID (Initiator Session ID) fields positioned within iSCSI PDU headers.

**Exploitation of Weak Authentication Protocols**

The Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) and its mutual variant are commonly used for iSCSI authentication. They are vulnerable to offline attacks if the challenge and response pairs are captured without encryption. Pentesters may use frameworks such as Metasploit to automate attacks against weakly configured CHAP-based authentication.

In Metasploit:
- Set up a `CHAP` module targeting the iSCSI server with known weak configurations.
- Analyze whether a captured series of challenge/response exchanges can reveal valid credentials.

#### Enumeration of iSCSI Nodes

**iSCSI Network Scanning**

Scanning tasks focus on identifying open ports that typically run iSCSI services. Port 3260 is conventionally used by iSCSI. Tools like Nmap are adept for such discovery tasks. Through service version probing scripts, details about the software running and potential weaknesses are highlighted.

Using Nmap for discovery:
- Run `nmap -p3260 -sV <target IP range>` to target and outline machines exposing iSCSI services.
- Evaluate service banners and determine critical details about server versions which might imply default open configurations.

**Initiator and Target Enumeration**

To enumerate iSCSI nodes, specialized tools such as `iscsi-scanner` or custom scripts formed using libraries like `python-iscsi` are deployed. These tools interact with iSCSI services to list available targets and initiators.

To enumerate targets:
- Execute `iscsi-scanner <target IP>` to uncover a list of iSCSI targets and potential initiator names.
- Analyze the interaction responses to detect clues that might inadvertently expose default or weakly protected credentials.

#### Brute Force and Password Guessing

**Dictionary and Brute Force Attacks**

Brute force and dictionary attacks aim at guessing login credentials by systematically trying combinations on network services. Tools such as Hydra and Medusa are effective at automating these tasks, especially on services using simple authentication mechanisms. Define set attacks with specific time delays and low request bursts to minimize detection risks.

Example command with Hydra:
- Example: `hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt iscsi://<target IP>/`
- Implement smart delays: `-t 1 -w 30` flag to introduce delay between attempts, aiming higher stealth.

#### Exploiting Misconfigurations

**Default Credentials and Poor Configuration Practices**

Exploitation often begins by checking whether default credentials are still enabled in production environments. Analyze publicly available manufacturer documentation to determine default username/password combinations. Implement penetration testing automation scripts that verify credential robustness.

**Cred Leaks in Internal Systems**

Investigate typical storage locations within a network environment where plaintext or reversible encryption of the credentials might be occluded â€“ such as configuration files or internal databases. This examination might involve searching for known file patterns or database tables referenced within iSCSI service or management software.

Use find or grep commands within Unix-based systems:
- Search command: `grep -r "password" /etc/iscsi/`
- Output investigation for any files that might match or resemble common password placeholders.

#### Access Escalation Post-Credential Discovery

**Lateral Movement via Discovered Credentials**

Exploiting discovered credentials requires attempting to access various nodes and systems within the network, often across other services that might recognize similar authentication tokens. Testing for credential reuse involves deploying these credentials, systematically, to probe access.

Commands mimic authentic initiator connections:
- Utilize `iscsiadm -m node -T <target IQN> -p <target IP>:3260 -l` to authenticate and connect using known login information.
- Analyze session establishment logs for abnormal patterns in auth traces.

**Targeted Attacks on iSCSI Components**

Once authenticated using legitimate credentials, an adversary might simulate the behavior of valid iSCSI initiators for carrying out potentially destructive or subversive activities. This could include transmitting commands to disconnect legitimate initiators or modifying target configurations.

Potential commands and actions:
- Leverage protocol-specific commands to initiate state changes on target machines.
- Adjust lifecycle management or replication settings, potentially triggering resource reallocation without permission.

#### Defensive Evasion Techniques

**Log and Alert Manipulation**

To avoid detection, obfuscate the footprints left by network activities involved in credential harvesting. Techniques include modifying or deleting log entries that track iSCSI login sessions or service inquiries. Use understanding of common logging mechanisms and administrative access to alter or clear data on the systems.

Scripting to cleanse logs:
- Example bash script snippet: `sed -i '/iscsi target login/d' /var/log/syslog*`
- Carefully clear targeted logs without disrupting or bringing attention to the system.

**Anti-Forensics Tactics**

Strategies necessitate removing or masking other digital artifacts left in the wake of attacks. Red Team tactics employ novel means for hiding tracks, such as creating fake connection entries or mimicking normal background operations to blend in with existing network noise.

Ensure comprehensive operations are not logged:
- Implement secure deletion commands such as `shred` to fully remove traces.
- Disguise network noise scripting tools to simulate expected traffic patterns via crafted PDU flood.
