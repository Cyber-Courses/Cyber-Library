# Detecting Active iSCSI Connections

## Understanding iSCSI Protocol

The iSCSI (Internet Small Computer Systems Interface) protocol enables clients (initiators) to send SCSI commands to storage devices (targets) over IP networks. At its core, it allows block-level access over standard network infrastructure, broadening the scope of storage accessibility and scalability. An iSCSI network topology typically includes one or more initiators that communicate with one or more targets across IP networks, often utilizing dedicated storage area networks (SANs).

iSCSI sessions are established when an initiator connects to a target using a unique session ID. This process includes various phases: login, full feature phase, and logout. During the login phase, authentication and security settings are negotiated. The full feature phase sees the actual SCSI command operations, and during logout, the session is terminated neatly.

Understanding these interactions and the underlying protocol stack is essential for effectively detecting active iSCSI connections. Knowledge of standard TCP/IP operations is crucial, as iSCSI operates over TCP port 3260 by default.

## Enumerating iSCSI Sessions

Network scanning techniques play a pivotal role in identifying active iSCSI sessions. Advanced network scanners like Nmap can be employed to probe networks for open iSCSI ports. Utilizing scripts or extensions for Nmap can enhance its ability to interrogate discovered services further, revealing iSCSI targets operating in the network.

```bash
nmap -p 3260 --script=iscsi-info <target-ip-range>
```

This command invokes the `iscsi-info` script, which attempts to enumerate available targets and basic session information. Complementary to scanning, capturing and analyzing network traffic using tools like Wireshark can reveal ongoing iSCSI communications when configured to monitor the relevant IP range and ports. The presence of login packets (iSCSI PDU type 0x03) can be indicative of active or attempted session establishment.

## Packet Analysis for iSCSI Connections

Deep packet inspection of iSCSI traffic can uncover session-specific details. By investigating the header and data segments of iSCSI protocol packets, it is possible to extract Session IDs, Target Names, and other session attributes. Network analysis tools allow the extraction of iSCSI-specific OpCodes (operation codes) from the packet headers, which can be used to assess the current state of the sessions.

For example, capturing and filtering network packets on port 3260 focused on iSCSI traffic can reveal a wealth of information. Identifying login requests, data-in, and data-out packets provide insights into the commands exchanged and the volume of data being transferred. Analysis requires a good understanding of the packet structure, including the Basic Header Segment (BHS), Data Segment, and key flags.

## Leveraging iSNS (Internet Storage Name Service)

The Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) facilitates the discovery and management of iSCSI storage resources within a network. iSNS servers maintain a directory of available targets and their current state, enabling storage system scalability and simplifying the management of complex storage networks.

Querying an iSNS server using its API or command-line tools allows administrators to identify active iSCSI services and even track session activity. Regular queries provide insights into active connections, which are otherwise hard to follow in dynamic network environments.

```bash
isnsadm -s <isns-server-ip> -q targets
```

This command accesses an iSNS server to list known iSCSI targets, providing a direct approach to discovering active elements within the storage network.

## Automated Tools for iSCSI Connection Detection

There exist several automated tools and frameworks designed specifically to facilitate iSCSI connection detection. Open-source tools such as `iscsiadm` can be scripted to query network targets continuously, automate session establishment checks, and even benchmark response latencies.

Wireshark supports custom scripting capabilities through Lua, enabling automated analysis scripts that can detect, log, and even alert based on custom filters. Similarly, integrating detection logic within network monitoring frameworks allows for real-time alerting and streamlined operations.

## Challenges in Detecting Stealthy iSCSI Connections

Sophisticated storage networks may employ advanced techniques to obfuscate iSCSI sessions, making detection complex. Techniques such as IP address obfuscation, traffic encryption, and tunneling over non-standard ports disrupt standard detection methodologies.

Detection can be counteracted by employing anomaly detection systems that monitor traffic patterns, bandwidth usage, and connection attempt frequencies. Statistical analysis can then be used to identify irregular patterns blended into regular traffic, hinting at potential stealthy iSCSI communications.

## Post-Detection Analysis

Post-detection analysis involves thorough auditing of session attempts and recording details of active sessions. This is complemented by cross-referencing network-level logs with the configurations of authenticated entities and permission settings to pinpoint any discrepancies or unauthorized access attempts.

iSCSI targets often employ CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) for authentication. Analysis of the CHAP exchange can reveal vulnerabilities if weak or improperly configured. Analyzing the iSCSI authentication mechanisms through log audits and configuration inspection ensures robust access control and hardening against attacks.

The detection of active iSCSI connections requires intricate knowledge of network protocols, specialized tools, and a systematic approach to network surveillance. With evolving storage infrastructure and increasing network complexity, continuous adaptation and upgrading of techniques remain imperative in the field of offensive cybersecurity.
