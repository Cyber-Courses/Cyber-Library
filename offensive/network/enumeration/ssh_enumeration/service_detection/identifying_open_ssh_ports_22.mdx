### Identifying Open SSH Ports (22)

#### Port Scanning Techniques

Network scanning is the foundational technique for identifying open SSH ports, often designated on TCP port 22. **Nmap** is a widely-used tool in this domain, allowing for the detection of open ports on a target system. By using simple commands like `nmap -p 22 <target-ip>`, one can initiate a scan specifically aimed at identifying SSH services. For more expansive scans, **Masscan**, known for its high speed, can be employed with commands such as `masscan -p22 <target-network> --rate <packets-per-second>`.

Timing plays a crucial role in balancing the speed of scanning versus detectability. Optimal timing parameters, such as those offered by Nmap's `-T` options (ranging from `-T0` for the slowest and most stealthy, to `-T5` for the fastest), can be adjusted to suit the operational environment. For stealthier operations, reducing the speed can help avoid detection by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

After detection, service enumeration tools can validate the presence of SSH. Tools such as **Netcat** can confirm services by connecting to the detected port, e.g., `nc -v <target-ip> 22`, and examining the service banner returned.

#### Advanced Scanning Practices

For bypassing network defenses and avoiding detection, distributed scanning techniques are invaluable. By distributing the scanning load across multiple IPs or using vantage points from different geolocations, recognition by network defenses becomes harder. Tools such as **zmap** can be tuned for distributed operations.

Scan obfuscation further masks scanning activity. Nmap supports decoy scanning (`nmap -D RND:10 <target-ip>`) where the scan is disguised by simulating multiple IP sources. This can be pivotal in avoiding firewall alerts.

#### Bypassing Firewalls and IDS/IPS

Circumventing firewalls and IDS/IPS can be accomplished through protocol misuse. Using non-standard ports or encoding SSH traffic as ICMP packets are common techniques. Exploratory packet fragmentation, which splits a packet into smaller segments (`nmap -f <target-ip>`), can evade some detection mechanisms.

Indirect scanning approaches, such as using DNS poisoning or MITM, allow attackers to redirect traffic towards their desired pathways. This method requires advanced knowledge of network configurations but can be a powerful means of analysis.

#### Analyzing Denied Connections

Understanding the nuances between responses from open and closed ports is essential. While open ports will often provide banner information, closed ports or filtered ports might drop requests altogether or reset connections. Analyzing network traffic logs and responses can help refine strategies to bypass these detections.

Conducting further network reconnaissance to identify defensive mechanisms aids in crafting a more nuanced attack strategy. Utilizing tools like **Wireshark** can help capture and analyze network traffic to observe filtering behaviors.

#### Automated Detection Tools

Automation improves efficiency and repeatability in detecting open SSH ports. Writing scripts in Python using libraries like **Scapy** or utilizing Bash scripting for integration with tools like Nmap streamlines this process. For instance, a Python script might use `import scapy.all as scapy` to craft packets directly for scanning purposes.

Integration with CI/CD pipelines allows for continuous scanning in environments that change dynamically. By regularly scanning for open ports, organizations can maintain security postures by identifying newly introduced SSH services, thereby reducing potential attack vectors. Deployment of automated scanning scripts that are triggered with each code change or network modification ensures persistent monitoring.

Through these detailed practices in identifying open SSH ports, offensive cybersecurity practitioners can enhance their methodologies, achieving precision and depth in their penetration testing and network analysis endeavors.
