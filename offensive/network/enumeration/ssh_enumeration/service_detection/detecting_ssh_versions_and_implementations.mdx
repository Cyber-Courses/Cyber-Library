# Detecting SSH Versions and Implementations

## Understanding SSH Protocols in Offensive Contexts

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used for secure network communications and is widely deployed across various networked environments. It operates in two primary versions: SSH-1 and SSH-2. SSH-1, being the older protocol, has significant security weaknesses, including vulnerability to MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks. SSH-2 introduced robust security features, including advanced encryption algorithms and better integrity checks.

From an offensive standpoint, understanding which version of SSH is in use on a target system is crucial. SSH-1, if detected, can be prioritized for attacks due to its known vulnerabilities. Even within SSH-2, different software implementations can vary in security posture based on configuration and patch level. Detecting the specific version and implementation helps identify potential weaknesses to exploit during a penetration test.

## Techniques for SSH Version Detection

### Banner Grabbing

Banner grabbing involves connecting to the SSH service to acquire the initial protocol message or banner, which typically includes the SSH version and software details. This is a straightforward way to identify unsecured or outdated services.

- **Netcat (nc)**: Use `nc` to establish a connection:
  ```bash
  nc <target_ip> 22
  ```
  Once connected, the SSH server's banner will usually be displayed, showing version information.

- **Telnet**: Similar to `nc`, employ `telnet` to get the banner:
  ```bash
  telnet <target_ip> 22
  ```

- **Nmap with Version Detection**: Use `nmap` with the `-sV` flag to automatically detect service versions:
  ```bash
  nmap -sV <target_ip> -p 22
  ```
  The `--version-intensity 5` option can be added to increase detection accuracy.

### Fingerprinting Techniques

Fingerprinting provides a deeper analysis beyond visible banners, often revealing anomalies in protocol implementation that distinctive fingerprint patterns could exploit.

- **ssh-audit Tool**: This tool evaluates SSH server configurations:
  ```bash
  ssh-audit <target_ip>
  ```
  It's used to analyze key exchange algorithms, encryption methods, and specific SSH software anomalies, revealing implementation details that banners might not show.

## Utilizing Tools for SSH Enumeration

### Nmap SSH Scripts

Nmap's scripting engine includes specific scripts for deeper SSH analysis:
- `ssh2-enum-algos`: Enumerates the cryptographic algorithms supported by the server.
  ```bash
  nmap --script ssh2-enum-algos <target_ip> -p 22
  ```
- `ssh-hostkey`: Extracts and fingerprints SSH server host keys, useful for persistence and detection of unauthorized key changes.

### Specific Enumeration Tools

- **ssh_scan**: Focuses on security auditing for SSH configurations, providing a report card on security implications:
  ```bash
  ssh_scan -t <target_ip>
  ```
  It highlights outdated versions, weak algorithms, or insufficient configuration features like enabled SSH-1 support.

- **ssh-audit**: This tool is comprehensive in assessing the security footprint of an SSH server, outputting detailed findings on all aspects of the protocol.

## Bypassing and Evading Detection Countermeasures

### Analyzing Traffic Patterns

An offensive practitioner can leverage traffic analysis to detect anomalies that might indicate SSH tunneling or obfuscation attempts. This involves monitoring for non-standard port usage or unusual encryption schema over default IP headers, providing clues to hidden SSH services.

### Overcoming Protocol Obfuscation

When SSH servers alter banners or employ honeypot strategies to mislead attackers, advanced fingerprinting can still uncover the truth. Using packet inspection tools capable of analyzing SSH handshake packets beyond the banner helps identify the true nature of an SSH service.

## Strategic Application in Offensive Operations

### Prioritizing Targets

SSH servers running vulnerable versions, like older OpenSSH with well-documented vulnerabilities, should be prioritized during an attack, especially if publicly exposed. This prioritization exploits potential entry points with lower resistance, maximizing attack impact efficiently.

### Combining Findings with Other Intelligence

Information gathered about SSH services must be integrated with data from other sources like DNS enumeration or web server reconnaissance. Together, these data sets allow attackers to fabricate strategies aligning with the discovered security landscape of a target network.

## Documentation and Reporting Best Practices

### Detailed Record-Keeping for SSH Findings

Maintaining accurate records of detected SSH versions and configurations is crucial. Penetration testers should document SSH fingerprints, version numbers, and configurations observed during enumeration to create comprehensive reports.

### Communicating Risks

Highlighting and communicating the risks associated with detected SSH vulnerabilities, such as exposure to remote code execution or weak encryption practices, is critical. These findings should be clearly outlined in reports delivered to stakeholders, alongside recommended mitigations like version upgrades or reconfiguration.
