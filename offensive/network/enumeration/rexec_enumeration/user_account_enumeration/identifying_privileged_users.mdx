# Identifying Privileged Users

### Understanding Privileged Accounts

Privileged accounts are user accounts with elevated permissions and access rights, often equivalent to or surpassing those of standard user accounts. These accounts typically include system administrators, network administrators, and service accounts with extensive permissions. They are characterized by their ability to make system-wide changes, access sensitive data, and manage other user accounts within an IT environment. In Windows environments, privileged accounts may belong to groups like "Administrators" or "Domain Admins," while on Unix-like systems, they often include "root" or users within the "wheel" group.

### Gathering Initial Information

In the context of identifying privileged users, initial information gathering is crucial. Begin by leveraging user enumeration results obtained from listing available user accounts. This data may be enriched with organizational resources such as company charts or employee directories, often revealing names, roles, or departments that correlate with IT administration or elevated responsibilities. Sophisticated social engineering tactics might also provide insights about privileged accounts through direct or indirect interactions with organizational staff who can provide the necessary context about staff responsibilities.

### Utilizing Built-In Network Tools

Network tools embedded within operating systems can effectively identify privileged users. On Windows, the command-line utility `net user` can display global user information and highlight members of the "Administrators" or "Remote Desktop Users" groups, suggesting elevated privileges. Command example: 
```shell
net user /domain
```
For Unix-like systems, commands such as `id`, `getent`, and `sudo -l` can be used to check for group memberships and permissible actions:
```shell
getent group wheel
```
These tools are essential for initial assessments before more invasive techniques are employed.

### Analyzing Group Memberships

Group membership often reveals insights into user privileges. In a Windows ecosystem, groups like "Domain Admins", "Enterprise Admins", or "Schema Admins" signify users with widespread access. Linux systems follow a similar paradigm, where presence in the "wheel" or "sudoers" file indicates higher permissions. By analyzing group memberships of users, you can often determine the scope of a user's potential access and whether privilege escalation paths are viable. Maintaining a script or automated tool to periodically check and report on group memberships can aid in surfacing changes indicating elevated access.

### Monitoring for Elevated Permissions

Detection frameworks and logging solutions like SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management) can monitor for elevated permissions by recognizing anomalous or unauthorized use of privileged commands. In environments using PowerShell, logging PowerShell command calls or leveraging modules such as "DeepBlueCLI" for in-depth analysis is beneficial. The monitoring configuration should include changes to permissions on key files, usage of `sudo`, or additions to privileged groups, providing an alerting mechanism for potential misuse or privilege escalations.

### Abusing Network Protocols for Privilege Identification

Abusing network protocols, particularly directory services such as Active Directory’s LDAP, allows for comprehensive enumeration beyond localized commands. By crafting LDAP queries, attackers can extract user attributes and group memberships, providing a clear indicator of privilege levels. An example LDAP query could filter users by specific privileges:
```shell
ldapsearch -x -b "dc=example,dc=com" "(memberof=cn=Administrators,cn=Builtin,dc=example,dc=com)"
```
In Samba or other NetBIOS environments, similar enumeration can occur through tools like `enum4linux`.

### Privilege Escalation Tactics

With privileged accounts identified, privilege escalation tactics can be devised to obtain elevated access. These strategies often leverage known vulnerabilities, credential harvesting, or misconfigurations to transition from regular user access to privileged user control. On Windows, techniques like token impersonation using tools such as Mimikatz, while on Linux, enumeration scripts like `LinEnum.sh` might reveal potential escalation vectors. The aim is to pivot using these accounts across network layers to gain ultimate administrative control.

### Post-Escalation Tracking

Upon achieving privileged access, maintaining this access becomes critical to operational goals. Techniques such as establishing persistence mechanisms—through services, scheduled tasks on Windows, or cron jobs on Unix—ensure that privileged control remains available. Strategies might also involve modifying host-based firewall rules, altering logging to hide tracks, or embedding backdoors within network management scripts. All actions must be carefully cataloged and managed to uphold the integrity and secrecy of the elevated access without triggering detection mechanisms. 

By implementing a continuous review of permissions and maintaining an operational log, security practitioners ensure the efficacy of maintaining control over these privileged accounts while minimizing detection risks.
