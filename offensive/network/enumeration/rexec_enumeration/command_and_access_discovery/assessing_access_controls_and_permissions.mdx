### Assessing Access Controls and Permissions

Understanding and assessing access controls and permissions is crucial in determining the security posture of a network. It involves identifying and analyzing how privileges are assigned to users and systems, allowing you to discover potential vulnerabilities that may be exploited for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

#### Identifying User Accounts

In offensive cybersecurity, identifying user accounts that hold significant permissions is a primary step. These accounts could provide access to sensitive areas or functions within a network. To enumerate these accounts:

- **LDAP Queries**: If the target network uses directory services like Active Directory, LDAP queries can be utilized to extract user account details. The command-line tool `ldapsearch` can be employed to perform these queries:

  ```bash
  ldapsearch -x -h <LDAP_SERVER> -D "<BIND_DN>" -w <PASSWORD> -b "<BASE_DN>" "(objectClass=person)" cn uid
  ```

- **Net Commands**: On Windows networks, the `net user` command can be used locally or over SMB to list users:

  ```shell
  net user /domain
  ```

#### Analyzing Permission Inheritance

Permission inheritance in file systems or directory services can inadvertently grant higher privileges than intended, creating security risks. Understanding and analyzing these permissions help in identifying such risk points.

- Tools like `icacls` on Windows can list inherited permissions on files and folders, highlighting potential vulnerabilities:

  ```shell
  icacls "C:\Path\To\Directory" /T | findstr "Inherited"
  ```

- For complex environments, scripts can be used to recursively identify permission inheritance and display anomalous privileges.

#### Enumerating Group Memberships

Group memberships often dictate what resources or permissions a user will inherit. Enumerating group memberships is critical to understanding how access is structured:

- On Windows, `net group /domain` can list all groups, helping in mapping users to their respective privilege levels.
  
  ```shell
  net group "Domain Admins" /domain
  ```

- On UNIX-like systems, `/etc/group` file can be parsed to find group memberships:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/group
  ```

#### Access Control List (ACL) Analysis

ACLs specify individual user or group permissions on resources. Analyzing them reveals how roles and permissions are defined and can uncover misconfigurations:

- Using `getfacl` on UNIX systems, operators can view ACL entries for understanding current permissions:

  ```bash
  getfacl /path/to/file
  ```

- On Windows, the `powershell` cmdlet `Get-Acl` helps in extracting ACL data for further analysis:

  ```powershell
  Get-Acl C:\Path\To\Resource | Format-List
  ```

#### Detecting Excessive Permissions

Excessive permissions can lead to security weaknesses allowing attackers an easier path to privilege escalation. This involves comparing actual permissions against least privilege guidelines and identifying discrepancies.

- Automated tools like `Bloodhound` can be used in Active Directory environments to visualize and detect excessive permissions and potential attack paths.
  
- Manual reviews of permission sets against business processes help in identifying unneeded privileges.

#### Bypassing Access Restrictions

By understanding misconfigured permissions, attackers may bypass normal access restrictions. This involves exploiting permission exploits and leveraging found paths to increase access:

- Using known vulnerabilities in misconfigured systems or overly permissive ACLs allows attackers to execute commands or access data beyond their current privileges.

- Techniques such as DLL hijacking or escalating host machine permissions by exploiting service vulnerabilities are common methods of bypassing.

#### Credential Harvesting Preparation

Weak permissions can expose credential files or stores to an adversary. Preparation involves identifying such potential exposures for extraction:

- Using `Mimikatz` to exploit Windows credential stores exposed due to weak file permissions:

  ```shell
  sekurlsa::logonpasswords
  ```

- For UNIX systems, inspecting shadow files and comparing hashes can lead to credential extraction when permissions allow unauthorized access.

#### Privilege Escalation through Permissions

After identifying weaknesses, privilege escalation becomes a target to gain further access or control. By leveraging the discrepancies in permissions, operators can elevate their privileges:

- Escalating privileges by exploiting permission flaws found during enumeration, such as adding the current user to a privileged group.

- Employing scripts and automated tools that can exploit privilege escalation vectors highlighted by weak permission configurations.

#### Cleanup and Logging

Once assessments are complete, cleaning up traces to avoid detection is necessary. This involves understanding how logs are generated and stored:

- Resetting permissions or reversing changes made during testing:

  ```bash
  chmod 700 /path/to/previously/modified/file
  ```

- Modifying or deleting logs related to these operations, often requiring access to system-level logging mechanisms. However, ethical considerations and legal boundaries must always be observed.

Through these detailed explorations, offensive practitioners can methodically assess, exploit, and utilize access controls and permissions, broadening their understanding and capabilities within network environments.
