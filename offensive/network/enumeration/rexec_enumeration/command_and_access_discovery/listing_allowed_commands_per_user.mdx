# Listing Allowed Commands per User

## Understanding Rexec Protocol

Rexec, short for remote execution, is a protocol that allows for the execution of processes in a remote environment. It operates over the TCP/IP network and is built to permit the execution of commands on remote machines securely over a network. Unlike protocols like SSH or Telnet, Rexec notably enhances security by requiring authentication via username and password before a session can be established. This capability is crucial in environments where sensitive operations or processes need to be controlled remotely, ensuring that only authenticated users can run specific commands on networked systems.

The foundational purpose of Rexec is to provide a service for executing commands on remote servers securely. At a higher level, it bears similarity to protocols like SSH, which also offer remote command execution but with differing security models and methods. The fundamental distinction lies in how these protocols handle authentication and encryption; Rexec relies on simple username-password credentials without default encryption, whereas others like SSH enforce encryption. Thus, understanding these baseline features of Rexec is essential for evaluating its place within broader security models.

Authentication within Rexec is straightforward: it relies upon credentials supplied at the outset of establishing a session. This includes providing a username and password combination verified by the server before executing commands. Unlike other protocols emphasizing key-based authentication, Rexec focuses on credential-based access, which, while simpler, necessitates stringent management of user credentials and access privileges to prevent unauthorized access.

## Credential Harvesting Techniques

Credential harvesting within the context of Rexec primarily revolves around intercepting and extracting login credentials from network traffic. Since Rexec traffic may not always be encrypted, monitoring traffic between a client and server can yield valuable login information, which can then be extracted for unauthorized use. A common methodology for harvesting these credentials is through packet capture tools such as Wireshark or tcpdump, which enable an attacker to capture the data being transmitted over the network.

Once captured, credentials might be stored in various formats, depending on how they are used and secured within the target environment. Attackers often exploit unsecured storage locations such as configuration files, scripts, or unsecured registry entries on Windows systems where they may be stored in plaintext.

Decryption and decoding of harvested credentials may be required if they are stored in encoded formats, employing knowledge of specific hashing algorithms like base64, MD5, or SHA-based hashing algorithms. Tools like hashcat can be used to brute-force or crack these hashes when necessary to retrieve plaintext usernames and passwords for use in subsequent attack vectors.

## User Enumeration via Rexec

User enumeration exploits features or vulnerabilities in systems to identify valid usernames on a server. In the context of Rexec, this process involves probing the server for information about active user accounts that possess privileges to execute commands. This can be achieved by brute-forcing login attempts with a list of potential usernames and analyzing the responses from the server for distinctions between failed and successful logins.

Known vulnrability scanning tools, when configured correctly, can automate this process by using a list of common usernames and testing each against the Rexec service to compile a list of valid accounts. This gathered information becomes the basis for conducting further attacks targeted at the exploitation of command permissions.

Extracting specific user account details can sometimes be enabled when Rexec services are improperly configured or when detailed error messages provide usernames during authentication attempts. Exploiting these data disclosure scenarios can quickly give attackers a map of vulnerable entry points into the system.

## Command Listing Techniques

Understanding which commands are permitted per user within the context of Rexec involves reverse-engineering and exploring default and custom configurations. The default command set may include basic system utilities and network tools available to all users, but roles and permissions ultimately dictate command accessibility.

A strategic approach is the enumeration of command permissions tailored to user roles. Tools familiar with network services and protocols like `nmap`, `metasploit`, and custom scripts can be useful in identifying and organizing commands into understandable lists.

Rexec allows command discovery by executing benign commands that explore file directories, system process lists, and configurations. Users can leverage benign commands like `ls`, `whoami`, `id`, and similar utilities to gain insights into permission boundaries. Analyzing environment variables or system paths (often accessible by default) can hint at command availability and also scriptable automation of these tasks.

## Exploiting Misconfigured Rexec Services

Exploiting Rexec configurations involves identifying conditions where preset security guidelines are lax. Common misconfigurations include improperly set access lists or weak user passwords that can be easily guessed or cracked, granting broader command abilities to non-privileged users.

Exercises in privilege escalation can use unwarranted commands to gain higher-level access, pivoting into more restricted sections of a network or natively executing restricted tasks. Furthermore, combinations of misconfigured command permissions could enable escalation from user to root privileges, typically by manipulating system binaries or executing system updates that have elevated access rights assigned by mistake.

## Bypassing Command Restrictions

Circumventing command restrictions requires a deep understanding of allowed commands and their interdependencies within Rexec environments. One approach is leveraging the allowed commands to achieve indirect execution of blocked ones by chaining simpler commands, orchestrating operations that result in the desired command's effect without calling it directly.

Payload crafting comes into play when needing to evade execution restrictions. Crafting payloads, such as script files or binaries that exploit dependencies or authorized utilities within the environment, can facilitate the indirect execution of banned operations. Such payloads can masquerade as normal, unprivileged user activities to evade detection mechanisms.

## Enumerating Command Usage Logs

Command usage logs under Rexec are a treasure trove for assessing what has historically been executed by users. Obtaining access to these logs allows attackers to hypothesize about system use patterns, command dependencies, and application patches during manual audits or log file analysis.

Accessing command usage logs requires requisite privileges, but misconfiguration or unguarded log files can be targeted using basic file discovery and enumeration techniques. Parsing and analyzing log strings and timestamps helps evaluate which commands are commonly executed and can spotlight potential entry points or loopholes in the systemâ€™s defenses.

Leveraging log data involves the extrapolation of command access patterns, ultimately informing strategic decisions regarding which subsequent actions are least likely to trigger alerts or alarms based upon historical use.

## Ensuring Operational Security during Enumeration

Operational security during enumeration activities is paramount to avoiding detection by monitoring systems. Customizing scripts to mimic legitimate user behavior and timing actions to align with expected user activities can mask undesirable intrusion characteristics.

Incorporating silent enumeration techniques, such as randomizing delays between operations or using low-bandwidth traffic, helps maintain a low profile. The goal is to gather as much actionable information without triggering security countermeasures, preserving the element of surprise for future engagements.

## Tools for Automated Command Discovery

Automated command discovery leverages specialized tools that provide efficiency and accuracy in identifying command sets per user. Tools like `Nmap`, `Metasploit`, and `recon-ng` can be expanded with modules or customized to fit the specifics of Rexec command discovery.

Integration into existing enumeration frameworks provides seamless transition between stages of enumeration and exploitation, improving workflow efficiency without compromising on the granularity required during offensive operations.

## Interpreting Results and Strategic Follow-up

Results from command discovery exercises are analyzed to identify offensive opportunities that were previously hidden. The collected dataset informs which commands offer leverage points for access and control over critical systems or data.

Strategically planning follow-up moves entails leveraging command allowances to install persistence mechanisms, execute further information-gathering exercises, or initiate network traffic for data exfiltration. Intelligent, informed action is derived from baseline access levels, ensuring further operations are appropriately aligned to achieved capabilities.

The ability to independently validate the actions and responses derived from enumerated command access sets establishes credibility for the offensive campaign's overall objectives and execution.
