### Full Connect Scan in Identifying Open Ports

#### Overview of Full Connect Scan

A full connect scan, also known as a TCP connect scan, is a network scanning technique used to identify open ports on a target system. This scan completes the TCP three-way handshake process, establishing a full connection with each target port to determine if they are open. Unlike SYN scans, which perform a half-open connection to minimize detection, full connect scans are more forward and easy to detect, providing a clear indication of the presence of an active scanner. This method, while less stealthy, is straightforward and often supported by default in many scanning tools, making it a reliable choice for confirming open ports.

#### TCP Three-Way Handshake

The TCP three-way handshake is fundamental to understanding full connect scans. The process begins with the scanner sending a SYN (synchronize) packet to the target port. If the port is open, the target responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet. The scanner then completes the handshake by sending an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the target. Upon completion of this handshake, the connection is considered established, and the scanner knows the port is open. Closing the connection usually follows with an RST (reset) packet sent by the scanner.

This complete handshake process provides the assurance that a port is not only open but also capable of processing a full TCP session, making it a robust method for correlation in offensive operations.

#### Execution of Full Connect Scan

Tools like `nmap` are commonly used to perform full connect scans. The command to execute a full connect scan using `nmap` is straightforward:

```bash
nmap -sT <target>
```

Here, `-sT` specifies the full connect scan type, and `<target>` is the IP address or hostname of the system being scanned. Additional parameters can be included to refine the scan, such as specifying a range of ports with `-p` or adjusting timing options with `-T`.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

Full connect scans offer several advantages. Their main advantage is reliability due to the completion of the three-way handshake, providing confirmation that the port is genuinely open. They are also less susceptible to TCP spoofing tricks that might mislead half-open scans.

However, the primary disadvantage of full connect scans is their high profile. Completing the handshake makes these scans easy to detect by network monitoring tools, which can log connection attempts. Additionally, these scans are slower than SYN scans because of the overhead of managing full TCP connections.

#### Detection and Evasion Techniques

Network security systems like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can easily detect full connect scans due to their complete session establishment pattern. These systems commonly log these events as potential probes or reconnaissance activities.

To evade detection, attackers might spread their scanning activities over extended periods, randomize the order of IPs scanned, or limit the rate of connection attempts. These strategies aim to disguise the scan as normal traffic patterns.

#### Performance Considerations

Full connect scans require more network resources because every connection must be fully opened and closed. This can place a higher load on both the scanning system and the target network. Managing this overhead involves setting appropriate timing options to prevent overwhelming the network and ensuring accurate results without triggering alarms.

When scanning extensive network ranges, scanning can be time-consuming. Applying scan timing options (`-T0` to `-T5`) in `nmap` helps balance between speed and stealthiness. For large datasets, automating and parallelizing the tasks can improve efficiency while maintaining manageable network load.

#### Comparisons with Other Scans

Compared to SYN scans, full connect scans are more detectable but offer more reliable results due to the completion of a full handshake. SYN scans, while stealthier, only provide indications of open ports and rely on the target halting the handshake prematurely.

In contrast to UDP scans, which target connectionless protocols, full connect scans provide deterministic results, verifying both connectivity and service responsiveness. UDP scans are often less reliable, given the silent nature of closed UDP ports and the challenges posed by firewall rules.

#### Real-World Application

Full connect scans are particularly effective in environments where stealth is not a primary concern, such as internal networks or during consent-based security assessments. They help ensure that no open port is overlooked due to half-open measures that might miss anomalies or firewall configurations.

Determining the scope of a full connect scan involves defining explicit ranges of IPs and ports, taking into account the organizational policies and the legal boundaries under which the scan is conducted.

#### Safety and Compliance

Performing full connect scans requires adherence to legal standards and obtaining necessary permissions, since these activities generate transparent network traffic that can be mistaken for malicious probing. Security professionals must ensure their activities are compliant with the law and clear with authoritative stakeholders to prevent legal repercussions.

#### Tools and Automation

Modern scanning frameworks often integrate full connect scans as part of a larger suite, enabling automation within continuous penetration testing environments. Tools can automate the reporting process, converting scan data into actionable insights for defensive strategies.

In conclusion, full connect scans offer thorough and robust conformation of open ports at the cost of stealth, making them suitable for specific scenarios where reliability is prioritized over covertness in the offensive cybersecurity toolkit.
