# Full Connect Scan

## Overview of Full Connect Scan

A Full Connect Scan, also known as a TCP Connect Scan, is a type of network scanning technique that attempts to establish a full TCP connection. This scan operates by completing the TCP three-way handshake process with each target port. Once the connection is successfully established, the scanner immediately disconnects, indicating that the port is open and potentially vulnerable to attacks. Historically, Full Connect Scans have been pivotal in network scanning due to their capability to provide conclusive results regarding the status of network ports.

The significance of Full Connect Scans lies in their ability to interact with the target host in a manner that is consistent with normal network communication protocols. Despite being less stealthy than other scanning techniques, Full Connect Scans are valued for their thorough approach, ensuring that all potential communication with the target network is explored.

## How Full Connect Scan Works

Full Connect Scans operate through the TCP three-way handshake process, which involves three primary steps: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK. Initiated by the scanning tool, the process begins with a SYN packet sent to the target port. If the port is open, the target responds with a SYN-ACK packet. The scanner then completes the handshake by sending an ACK packet back to the target. This sequence guarantees the establishment of a genuine TCP connection, confirming the port's availability.

Underlying network protocols such as IP (Internet Protocol) play a crucial role in facilitating a Full Connect Scan. Protocol layers are traversed to ensure that the network packets are delivered and acknowledged correctly. The exhaustive methodology of Full Connect Scans ensures that network ports are consistently validated regardless of network configuration or specific operating system quirks that alternative scanning methods might encounter.

## Purpose of Full Connect Scan

The primary goal of a Full Connect Scan is to identify open ports and services running on a target system, which helps in understanding the potential vectors for attack or monitoring network compliance. By confirming the establishment of a full TCP connection, this scan type confirms not only the openness of a port but also verifies the responsiveness of services listening on it.

When compared with other less intrusive scanning methods, Full Connect Scans provide more reliable results in terms of accuracy, as they mitigate the risk of false negatives. Unlike SYN Scans which might be blocked by firewalls or configured to permit only established connections, a Full Connect Scan bypasses these limitations by leveraging the standard handshake.

## Advantages of Full Connect Scan

The most significant advantage of Full Connect Scans is their reliability and completeness. By executing the entire TCP handshake, these scans offer unparalleled accuracy in determining the port status. This method leaves little room for ambiguity regarding service availability, ensuring that results are both comprehensive and dependable.

Moreover, Full Connect Scans supply an extensive set of data about the network, making it possible to identify specific services and possibly even gather information about the targeted system's operating environment. Considering these attributes, Full Connect Scans are considered a cornerstone in thorough network scanning operations, particularly useful in compliance and auditing scenarios.

## Limitations of Full Connect Scan

Despite their comprehensive nature, Full Connect Scans suffer from several limitations, particularly in terms of performance overhead and detection. Completing the TCP handshake for every open port encountered means a higher consumption of network resources, potentially impacting both the scanner and target network's performance.

Additionally, Full Connect Scans are more easily detected by firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). These security mechanisms recognize the full handshake process as definitive scan activity, thereby making it unsuitable in situations where stealth and nondisclosure are critical.

## Full Connect Scan Techniques

Manual execution of Full Connect Scans can be achieved using network utilities like `telnet` or `nc (netcat)` where users manually invoke processes to perform TCP connections to target ports. However, automated tools and scripts like Nmap are often employed to perform Full Connect Scans, which streamline the scanning process across potentially thousands of ports.

Various techniques can be applied depending on network conditions, such as adjusting the rate of packet sending or employing connection re-establishment procedures to cope with network timeouts or high latency conditions. The success of Full Connect Scans hinges on correctly configuring these parameters to match the targeted network's characteristics without causing resource exhaustion or alerts.

## Interactions with Firewalls and IDS/IPS

Firewalls typically impede Full Connect Scans by blocking initial SYN packets or resetting connections upon detecting the completion of a handshake. This action results in a rapid termination of the connection attempt, thereby impeding the scan's ability to provide accurate results. To counteract these effects, scanners may employ techniques such as IP source routing or fragmentation, though these are often less effective against modern, sophisticated firewalls.

IDS/IPS systems are designed to detect the regular pattern of a Full Connect Scan, flagging and potentially blocking the scanning IP address. However, evasive methods can be employed, such as randomizing the scan rate, using decoy addresses, or spreading scan activity across broader networks, although these are complex and require careful implementation to avoid inadvertent legal consequences.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Conducting Full Connect Scans requires adherence to legal standards and ethical guidelines. Unauthorized scanning can be deemed illegal under computer misuse legislation in many jurisdictions, irrespective of intent. Therefore, acquiring explicit permission and ensuring adherence to regulatory frameworks is paramount for those performing Full Connect Scans.

Ethical considerations include respecting the privacy and security practices of third parties, ensuring that scan activity does not result in unplanned service disruptions or data exposure. Scanners must follow industry best practices such as full disclosure to network administrators and maintaining detailed records of scan activities to ensure transparency and accountability.

## Application and Use Cases

Full Connect Scans are typically employed in situations where obtaining accurate and comprehensive data about network status is critical, such as during a security audit or network compliance check. They are preferred in internal network environments where the risk of scan detection is acceptable, and thoroughness is prioritized over discretion.

Differentiating from other techniques like SYN or UDP Scans, Full Connect Scans are not usually employed in red team exercises where stealth is prioritized but rather in environments where services must be affirmed as operational and network baselines need to be established. In such use cases, especially in staging environments or isolated network segments, Full Connect Scans provide valuable insights needed for enhancing network configurations and security postures.
