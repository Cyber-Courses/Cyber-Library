# SYN Scan

## Introduction to SYN Scan

A SYN scan is a type of network scanning technique used to identify open ports on a target machine by exploiting the TCP three-way handshake. This scan is considered a "half-open" scan because it does not complete the full handshake process. Instead, the scanner sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to a target port, waits for a response, and then moves on without sending the final ACK (acknowledgment) packet. 

The primary advantage of a SYN scan lies in its ability to determine the state of a port stealthily and efficiently. It is less likely to be logged by the targeted system, making it a preferred technique among attackers who wish to remain undetected. Compared to other port scanning techniques, such as the Full Connect Scan, the SYN scan is faster and consumes fewer resources, thus making it more suitable for scanning large networks.

## TCP Three-Way Handshake

The TCP three-way handshake is a fundamental process that establishes a connection between a client and a server over a network. It involves the exchange of three types of packets: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK. Initially, the client sends a SYN packet to the server to indicate a connection request. In response, the server sends back a SYN-ACK packet if the port is open, signaling its readiness to establish a connection. Finally, the client sends an ACK packet to complete the handshake, enabling data transmission.

A SYN scan utilizes only the first step of this handshake process. By sending a SYN packet and analyzing the response, it infers the state of the port without completing the connection. If a SYN-ACK is received, the port is considered open. If an RST (reset) packet is returned, the port is closed. If there is no response, the port may be filtered by a firewall.

## Methodology of SYN Scan

The SYN scan begins by crafting SYN packets targeting specific ports on a host machine. The scan involves sending these packets consecutively to various ports to gauge their openness. Upon sending a SYN packet, the scanner waits for a response from the target.

Several responses indicate different states:
- **SYN-ACK**: An open port that is ready to establish a connection.
- **RST**: A closed port, rejecting connection attempts.
- **No Response**: Indicates possible filtering by firewalls or packet loss.

Tools like nmap utilize SYN scans effectively. An nmap SYN scan is executed using the `-sS` flag, which directs the tool to perform a SYN scan, analyzing the packet responses to map out open, closed, and filtered ports efficiently.

## Benefits of SYN Scans

SYN scans are preferred for several reasons. First, their speed and efficiency are noteworthy; they quickly assess the state of ports by avoiding the overhead of establishing complete TCP connections. This makes them suitable for rapid scanning of large networks.

Another benefit is their low-profile nature. Since they do not complete the TCP handshake, there is minimal logging on the target system. This characteristic makes SYN scans ideal for stealth in reconnaissance missions where detection needs to be minimized.

## Limitations of SYN Scans

Despite their advantages, SYN scans can be intercepted by modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). These systems are designed to detect anomalies in network traffic, including half-open connections that are indicative of SYN scans.

Security mechanisms like firewalls may also pose limitations. They often implement SYN rate limiting and other heuristics to mitigate scans, dropping or blocking incoming SYN packets that exceed specified thresholds. Additionally, the use of session timeouts and other advanced filtering techniques can obscure scan results, leading to incomplete or erroneous data.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Conducting SYN scans without permission is illegal and unethical. Unauthorized network scanning can be considered an attempt to breach security, making it essential to gain explicit permission from the network owner before proceeding.

From an ethical standpoint, even with permission, scans should be conducted responsibly. This includes assessing potential risks and avoiding actions that could disrupt the normal operations of the target network. Researchers and penetration testers should follow established guidelines and ensure their activities comply with regional legal frameworks.

## Countermeasures and Defense

To defend against SYN scans, networks can employ various monitoring and detection strategies. Regularly updated IDS can detect scan patterns and trigger alerts based on suspicious activity. Implementing SYN cookies is another effective strategy; they validate SYN packets without storing state information, mitigating SYN flood attacks.

Firewalls play a critical role in preventing SYN scans. By limiting the rate of SYN packets and implementing strict filtering policies, firewalls can effectively block or obscure the results of SYN scans.

## Advanced SYN Scan Techniques

Advanced SYN scan techniques involve methods to improve stealth and evade detection. Spoofing source IP addresses can disguise the origin of a scan, while randomizing the order of scanned ports makes it harder for security systems to identify patterns.

By incorporating timing and delay techniques, SYN scans can avoid triggering automatic defense mechanisms, such as connection limits or anomaly detection thresholds set on networks. Through careful manipulation of these parameters, attackers can increase the likelihood of remaining undetected while scanning for open ports.
