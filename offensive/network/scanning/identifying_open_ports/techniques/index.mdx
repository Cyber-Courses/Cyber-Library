# Techniques for Identifying Open Ports

## SYN Scan

SYN scan, often referred to as a half-open scan, is a fundamental technique used in network reconnaissance to identify open ports on a target system. The primary characteristic of a SYN scan is its ability to discover port states without establishing a full TCP connection. It achieves this by sending a SYN packet to target ports and analyzing the response.

When a SYN packet is sent, three types of responses can be expected:
- **SYN-ACK**: Indicates that the port is open. The scanner may then send an RST packet to avoid completing the TCP handshake.
- **RST**: Indicates that the port is closed.
- **No response**: Suggests the port might be filtered by a firewall or not responding.

SYN scans are preferred due to their speed and stealth. They typically require root privileges due to the crafting of raw packets but are less likely to be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) since the full connection is not established. However, they are not foolproof; advanced firewalls and detection mechanisms can identify and mitigate these scans.

## Full Connect Scan

The Full Connect Scan, or TCP Connect Scan, completes the entire TCP handshake process to determine the status of a port. Unlike the SYN scan, this method goes through the complete cycle, establishing and then tearing down a real connection.

The process involves:
1. Sending a SYN packet to the target port.
2. Receiving a SYN-ACK (port is open) or an RST (port is closed) in response.
3. In the case of receiving a SYN-ACK, sending an ACK to complete the handshake and then an RST to close the connection.

Full Connect Scans are arguably more reliable as they confirm the full functionality of a port, ensuring that not only is the port open, but it can also sustain a complete transaction. One of the key advantages is that Full Connect Scans do not require root privileges and can work effectively on any operating system. However, this method is easily detectable by network security systems since each scanned port leaves a log entry, thereby increasing the likelihood of triggering security alerts.

## UDP Scan

The UDP Scan is utilized to identify open UDP ports on a target system. The nature of the UDP protocol, which is connectionless and does not require a handshake like TCP, makes UDP scanning both unique and challenging.

The procedure for UDP scanning involves:
- Sending a UDP datagram to each port.
- Analysing responses:
  - If the port is closed, an ICMP Port Unreachable message is usually returned.
  - No response typically indicates the port is open or filtered.

Because UDP does not establish a handshake, it can be more ambiguous to ascertain the state of a UDP portâ€”often necessitating multiple attempts to accurately interpret silence. The potential for delayed responses or packet loss means that UDP scans can require significantly more time compared to TCP scans. Additionally, many network devices deploy rate limiting for ICMP messages, potentially complicating the results. Despite these challenges, UDP scans are vital for identifying services that exclusively use UDP, such as DNS and SNMP.

## Stealth and Fragmented Scans

Stealth and fragmented scans are advanced techniques designed to bypass firewall rules and evade intrusion detection systems. They achieve this by manipulating packet structures and sequences in ways that are less likely to be logged or detected.

### Stealth Scans
- **NULL Scan**: Sends TCP packets with no flags set. The response can reveal open or closed ports based on the absence of a response or an RST, respectively.
- **FIN Scan**: Sends packets with only the FIN flag set, exploiting systems that respond with RST for closed ports but send no response if the port is open.
- **Xmas Scan**: Sends packets where the FIN, PSH, and URG flags are set.

These scans exploit TCP/IP stack implementation differences across operating systems, but their effectiveness has waned with improved security systems that can recognize and block such unconventional flag combinations.

### Fragmented Scans
Fragmented Scans divide packet headers into smaller fragments to potentially bypass filtering rules that only inspect the first packet component. This method challenges packet filters that do not reassemble fragmented packets before evaluation.

The primary advantage of these techniques is their potential to bypass poorly configured network security systems. However, the modern sophistication of IDS and firewalls often renders them detectable. Fragmented packets in particular can be prone to issues regarding fragment reassembly and network performance, which may disrupt regular operation or traffic flow.

In conclusion, understanding these scanning techniques allows network security professionals to not only perform comprehensive assessments but also prepare defenses against unauthorized scanning activities, ensuring robust cybersecurity strategies.
