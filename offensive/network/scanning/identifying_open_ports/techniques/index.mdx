# Techniques for Identifying Open Ports

## SYN Scan

SYN scans exploit the TCP three-way handshake process to determine the state of a port without completing the handshake fully, making it a preferred method for stealthy scanning.

- **TCP Handshake Mechanics:**
  - The TCP handshake begins with a SYN packet sent to initiate a connection. If the server responds with a SYN/ACK packet, the port is considered open. If an RST packet is received, the port is closed. No response might indicate a filtered port due to firewall rules.
  - Understanding these mechanics is critical for constructing effective SYN scans, as this method relies on partial completion of the handshake.

- **Crafting SYN Packets:**
  - SYN packets are crafted using tools like Nmap with commands such as `nmap -sS <target>`.  
  - These packets can be manipulated in ways, like varying the source IP, to bypass basic firewall rules and IDS systems, providing a snapshot of accessible services.

- **Interpreting Results:**
  - Open ports return a SYN/ACK, closed ports an RST, and filtered ports no response or filtered messages. Accurately interpreting these responses is vital for mapping out accessible ports.
  - Practitioners develop an understanding of network behavior by cross-referencing these results with known firewall policies and network architectures.

- **Evasion Techniques:**
  - Stealthy scanning involves manipulating packet flags and timing intervals via tools like Nmap’s `-T<0-5>` speed template to fly under the radar of security systems.
  - Assessing the network environment and adjusting scan velocity can prevent triggering alarms, ensuring deeper penetration without detection.

## Full Connect Scan

Full connect scans establish a complete connection, offering a higher fidelity picture of available services at the expense of stealth.

- **Comprehensive TCP Handshake:**
  - This scan uses the complete three-way handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK), which conclusively verifies the state of ports. The command `nmap -sT <target>` executes a full connect scan.
  - It's most effective on networks where detection is acceptable or access is authorized for testing purposes.

- **Identifying Closed Ports:**
  - By establishing a full connection, this technique precisely identifies open, closed, and filtered ports through direct interaction.
  - It's a powerful verification tool to cross-check other scanning methods' results, ensuring accuracy in network mapping.

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Full connect scans can generate significant network traffic and consume more resources due to the complete handshake process.
  - Understanding the impact on network infrastructure and the potential to trigger automated defenses or logging mechanisms is critical.

## UDP Scan

Due to its connectionless nature, UDP scanning poses unique challenges but is essential for discovering non-TCP services.

- **UDP Protocol Characteristics:**
  - Unlike TCP, UDP is stateless, meaning that open ports might not respond to probes, making detection complex.
  - When scanning with commands like `nmap -sU <target>`, one must factor in the variability of UDP responses.

- **Detecting Open UDP Ports:**
  - ICMP port unreachable messages often indicate closed ports, while the absence of such replies might suggest openness.
  - Responses specific to application behaviors (DNS, SNMP) can be used to infer the presence of active services.

- **Overcoming Limitations:**
  - Network behavior and scanning frequency must be managed due to UDP's susceptibility to packet loss and higher noise levels.
  - Techniques such as altering packet size or using crafted payloads can help increase the likelihood of accurate detection.

- **Amplification and Mitigation:**
  - UDP scans can inadvertently cause traffic amplification. Understanding this side effect is necessary to avoid potential DDoS-like behavior.
  - Tools should be set up to respect bandwidth limits and adhere to responsible disclosure practices when applied in real-world scenarios.

## Stealth and Fragmented Scans

Stealth and fragmented scanning techniques are geared towards bypassing IDS/IPS systems through non-standard packet crafting.

- **Evasion Strategies:**
  - By manipulating packet headers and flag settings stealthily, the attacks can remain undetected by many security systems. Commands like `nmap -sF` (FIN scan) or `nmap -sX` (Xmas scan) help in evasion.
  - Utilizing non-standard initiation packets or combining flags prevents simple pattern recognition by security devices.

- **Fragmentation of Packets:**
  - Using fragmented packets (`nmap -f`) can circumvent some basic intrusion detection systems by sending smaller, piecemeal packets.
  - This technique relies on the network's inability to reassemble these fragmented packets before deeper inspection, thus evading simpler security checks.

- **Advanced Timing and Sequential Ordering:**
  - Timing adjustments and randomized packet order can reduce the likelihood of detection, employing long-duration scanning techniques that don’t spike traffic.
  - Configuring network scans with innovative timing strategies ensures that the scanning footprint remains minimal and constant.

- **Countermeasure Awareness:**
  - Familiarity with defensive countermeasures such as anomaly-based intrusion detection systems helps refine scanning strategies.
  - Adapting scanning methods dynamically as countermeasures evolve ensures the continued effectiveness and relevance of stealth techniques. 

This comprehensive exploration equips offensive security practitioners with advanced capabilities to discover open ports while evading detection, supporting their objectives in penetration testing and red team engagements.
