# Scanning in Offensive Cybersecurity

Scanning forms the foundational aspect of offensive cybersecurity operations. It allows attackers to gather crucial information about target networks, identify vulnerabilities, and plan further exploits. This topic is part of a broader scope that includes Enumeration, Initial Access Techniques, Exploitation, and more, under the "offensive/network" category.

## Identifying Open Ports

### Port Scanning Fundamentals

Port scanning is a technique used to identify open doors to systems or networks. It involves sending packets to various TCP and UDP ports to gather information about which ports are open and what services might be running. Understanding TCP and UDP protocols is crucial, as TCP offers more controlled connectivity with acknowledgments, while UDP provides faster, connectionless communication which can be easily missed or misreported by scanners.

Key tools for port scanning include **Nmap** and **Masscan**. Nmap is highly versatile, capable of slower scans to avoid detection, while Masscan, known for its speed, can scan the entire Internet in less than six minutes. Configuration of these tools depends on scanning objectives, whether it's depth for identifying specific ports on a smaller set of IPs or breadth for scanning a wide range of IPs for particular ports.

Performing a scan can be initiated using:
```sh
nmap -sS -p 1-65535 <target-ip>
masscan -p80,443,22 --range 10.0.0.0/8
```

### Tool Sets and Techniques

Nmap is equipped with a rich suite of features for port scanning, like stealth SYN scans (`-sS`), and can adapt through firewall evasion and spoofing techniques (`-D`, `-S`, etc.). Masscan, although less subtle, can utilize asynchronous transmission to speed up the process while minimizing its visibility through reduced packet rates.

Evasion techniques play a significant role in the reliability of scans. Techniques such as using decoys, altering scan speeds, and fragmenting packets are used to make scans less noticeable to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and firewalls:
```sh
nmap -D RND:10,ME -sS <target-ip>
```

### Interpreting Scan Data

Interpreting the results of a scan involves analyzing the service banners and any responses provided by the open ports. Services might react differently to a request, and understanding these differences is key to recognizing the actual services running. Some results might be false positives, where the service appears to be running but is actually a honeypot or trap.

Beyond initial results, this data informs on subsequent attack vectors and should be logged meticulously:
```sh
nmap -oN output.txt <target-ip>
```

## OS and Version Detection

### Fingerprinting Techniques

OS and version detection is vital for tailoring specific exploits. Active fingerprinting involves sending packets to provoke responses that reveal OS characteristics â€” tools like Nmap can fingerprint using templates known as signatures.

Passive fingerprinting can be done by analyzing traffic without interaction, providing stealthy reconnaissance options. However, its accuracy often lags behind active methods due to reliance on observed characteristics rather than interactive data.

### Tool Optimization for Detection

Maximizing the capability of tools like Nmap for accurate detection involves utilizing version detection scripts `-sV` that can identify services running on open ports and provide a likely operating system:
```sh
nmap -A <target-ip>
```

Additional tools like **Xprobe2** refine the detection process, capable of detailed OS fingerprinting. Complementary tools such as **p0f** enhance passive detection:
```sh
xprobe2 -v <target-ip>
p0f -i <interface>
```

### Analyzing Fingerprinting Results

Once OS and version information is collected, it becomes an asset. The insights derived from fingerprinting allow attackers to adjust their exploit development or selection, maintaining relevance by exploiting known vulnerabilities within certain OS versions or unpatched services.

The interpretation must consider the possibility of deception through countermeasures like honeypots that falsely advertise their OS.

## Network Mapping

### Topological Mapping Strategies

Network mapping provides a broader picture of connectivity and paths for potential lateral movement. Traceroute tools map the path packets take to reach a target, allowing the discovery of network topology and potential chokepoints.

Engaging traceroute techniques:
```sh
traceroute <target-ip>
```

### Automation with Scripting

Automation with custom scripts drives efficiency, allowing continuous scanning and mapping without direct supervision. Scripts can incorporate APIs from scanning tools to dynamically update data based on network changes, integrating findings into larger campaigns.

Python scripts leveraging libraries like `scapy` can automate scanning processes, adapting to varying tactics:
```python
from scapy.all import traceroute
ips = traceroute(["<target-ip>",])
```

### Visualizing Networks

Visual representation of network structures through diagramming tools, in combination with insights from previously discussed tools, reveals attack potential and defensive weaknesses. Tools like **Maltego** or **Cytoscape** help in rendering comprehensive network maps that inform strategic decisions.

Strategically, visualization transforms raw data into actionable intelligence, aligning attack perspectives to forestall detection or overcome network defenses effectively. This visualization aids not only in the technical approach of an attack but also in high-level planning and decision-making.
