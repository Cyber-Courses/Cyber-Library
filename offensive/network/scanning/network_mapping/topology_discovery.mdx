# Topology Discovery in Offensive Cybersecurity

## Protocol Enumeration and Analysis

Topology discovery begins with leveraging specific network protocols known for divulging vital network topology information. Key protocols in this realm include Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

CDP and LLDP serve as a starting point for topology discovery as they are designed to advertise network device information to adjacent devices. Offensive cybersecurity practitioners can exploit these protocols to gather details such as device identifiers, capabilities, IP configurations, and VLAN membership. This data forms the foundational layer for mapping network connections and identifying device roles within the topology.

SNMP can further enhance this understanding by querying Management Information Bases (MIBs) on network devices. By enumerating SNMP, attackers can harvest extensive data on network infrastructure, such as routing tables and interface statistics. Utilizing tools like `snmpwalk`, operators can execute commands such as `snmpwalk -v2c -c public [IP_ADDRESS]` to probe target devices and extract hierarchical topology data.

## Advanced Network Scanning

Advanced network scanning techniques focus on penetrating deeper into network structures to uncover intricate topologies that basic scans may miss. Tools like Nmap support extensions (NSE scripts, for instance) that allow for tactic-driven scanning processes, designed to bypass typical security layers.

Scanning methodologies include directed scans that aim at revealing network segments untouched by simple sweeps. These scans employ specific timing and packet generation strategies to minimize detection. For example, execute a command like `nmap -A -T4 -p- [TARGET]` to comprehensively scan a target while evading basic intrusion detection systems through timing manipulation.

## Layer 2 Topology Mapping

Layer 2 topology mapping focuses on capturing and interpreting ARP tables, MAC addresses, and VLAN configurations. This layer involves direct interactions with switches and any devices within the same broadcast domain. Tools such as `arp-scan` can be employed to execute commands like `arp-scan -l` to output a list of active devices within the LAN, revealing IP-to-MAC correlations.

A thorough understanding of VLAN structures through tools that enumerate VLAN IDs further enriches this layer's mapping potential. Tapping into switch configurations or employing packet snooping with tools like Wireshark can also infer network segmentations and physical wiring dependencies.

## Network Diagram Inference

Inferencing network diagrams from gathered data requires both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The synthesis of information from enumeration and scanning lays the groundwork for constructing visual network representations. Tools such as NetworkMiner can automatically convert logs into diagrammatic topology views, enhancing operator understanding of complex network interconnections.

Automation streamlines this process, enabling adversaries to dynamically update network maps in response to evolving network configurations or defensive changes.

## Access Control Bypass Techniques

Evading network access controls is essential to achieving a comprehensive topology discovery. This involves identifying and exploiting misconfigurations within network segmentations, such as improperly set Access Control Lists (ACLs). Techniques may include traffic tunneling through trusted paths or exploiting lateral movement capabilities inherent in compromised hosts.

Analyzing ACLs and firewall rules using intercepted configurations helps in identifying weaknesses or oversight in the segmentation logic, enabling seamless terrain traversal during topology mapping.

## Graph Theory Application in Topology Mapping

Graph theory provides a powerful supplement to topology mapping by enabling the use of algorithms to model and analyze network structures as interconnected graphs. Concepts like shortest path determination and node centrality help in identifying critical connections or bottleneck nodes within the network.

Tools that integrate graph database capabilities, such as Neo4j, empower cybersecurity operators to run complex queries against network data, visualizing structures non-intuitively discoverable through direct observation.

## Stealth Techniques and Evasion

Critical to offensive operations is the ability to execute topology discovery stealthily. Techniques such as low-and-slow scanning or spoofing scans to appear as legitimate traffic reduce the risk of detection by network defenses. Protocol obfuscation or encrypted communication channels, such as those utilized in SYN-flood techniques, further disguise reconnaissance activities.

Employing frameworks like Metasploit, which allow for custom scan parameters and timers, helps execute these scans, avoiding standard logging and alerting mechanisms.

## Integration with Subnetwork Identification

Finally, effective topology discovery seamlessly integrates with subnetwork identification. This requires correlating discovered topological data with subnetwork-specific reconnaissance, blending IP ranges, domain data, and routing pathways. The integration amplifies the capability of operators to pinpoint undiscovered network segments, elevating the fidelity of offensive mapping operations.

Unified topology and subnetwork insights enable precise attack vector identification and facilitate dynamic attack re-strategizing based on current network scenarios, offering a holistic approach to offensive cybersecurity in network environments.
