# Offensive Cybersecurity: Network Mapping

---

### Topology Discovery

Topology Discovery in offensive cybersecurity focuses on mapping the target network’s architecture. This step is crucial to understand the layout of devices, communication paths, and potential security controls present within a network. By identifying key assets and the connections between them, attackers can strategize more effective points of entry or targets for exploitation.

**Active Probing:** 

Active probing involves directly interacting with network components to discern topology information. Tools like Nmap are essential for sending various packets and analyzing the responses. For example, the `nmap -sn [target-IP-range]` command performs a ping scan to discover live hosts within the specified IP range, providing a basic map of active devices.

Further, `traceroute [target-IP]` can map the path packets take to reach a destination, helping identify intermediary devices and potential bottlenecks. Combining these with ping sweep strategies offers a dynamic picture of the network layout.

**SNMP Enumeration:**

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) can expose critical network topology details by querying devices like routers and switches. Tools such as `snmpwalk` allow attackers to enumerate SNMP data. Executing `snmpwalk -v 2c -c public [target-IP]` can retrieve a plethora of network information, assuming default or weak community strings are set.

**Network Flow Analysis:**

Analyzing network traffic using tools like Tcpdump or Wireshark highlights communication patterns and potential segmentation within the network. For instance, capturing traffic with `tcpdump -i eth0` on a network interface can reveal IP addresses, protocols, and ports in use, providing valuable insights into how data traverses the network.

Topology discovery facilitates a deeper understanding of the network environment, exposing critical nodes and chokepoints that can be leveraged in further attack phases.

### Subnetwork Identification

Subnetwork Identification delves into pinpointing distinct subnetworks within a broader network architecture. Recognizing these subdivisions allows attackers to focus their efforts, uncover less securely managed segments, and identify entry points.

**CIDR Analysis:**

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is used to define subnetwork IP ranges. By analyzing target network CIDR notations, attackers can efficiently classify and segment IP ranges (`nmap -sL [target/CIDR]` lists all potential IP addresses in a subnet). This method helps identify logical separation and potential perimeter defenses between subnetworks.

**ARP Scans:**

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) scans are effective for mapping local network devices. By sending ARP requests to a range of IP addresses, attackers can discover devices based on their MAC addresses. Tools like `arp-scan --interface=eth0 [target-IP-range]` provide a quick overview of active machines within a subnetwork, facilitating further analysis or exploitation attempts.

**Rogue Device Detection:**

Identifying unauthorized devices involves scanning for anomalies or unexpected hardware on the network. By scrutinizing traffic patterns or changes in network inventory via passive scanning tools, attackers can spot and exploit unsecured or rogue devices. This technique often involves a combination of both active and passive reconnaissance to avoid detection while accumulating intelligence about the subnetwork environment.

Subnetwork identification is a crucial step in discerning the intricacies of a network’s organization. It aids in pinpointing less defended pathways, uncovering misconfigurations, and revealing the structure of network defenses.

Network Mapping forms the backbone of strategic offensive operations by allowing adversaries to gain complete visibility of the target network’s structure. Understanding the topology and subnetworks enables attackers to make informed decisions about which sections of a network to compromise and how to manipulate them effectively. This foundational knowledge is crucial for crafting sophisticated attacks with high impact potential.
