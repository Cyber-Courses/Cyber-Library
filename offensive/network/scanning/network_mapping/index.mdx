# Network Mapping

Network mapping is a crucial step in the reconnaissance phase of offensive cybersecurity operations, enabling attackers to gain a thorough understanding of the target network's architecture and connected devices. This process involves discovering the layout and structure of a network, identifying subnetworks, and analyzing device interconnections. This section explores two key subtopics: [Topology Discovery](#topology-discovery) and [Subnetwork Identification](#subnetwork-identification).

## Topology Discovery

Topology discovery involves identifying and mapping the devices and connections within a network to create a visual representation of its layout. This process is critical for understanding the structure of a network, identifying potential entry points, and planning subsequent attacks. Techniques for topology discovery can be broadly categorized into active probing techniques, passive analysis methods, and advanced routing protocol mapping.

### Active Probing Techniques

Active probing techniques involve directly querying network devices to gather information. This method usually involves using tools like Nmap and Netdiscover to send packets to devices and analyze their responses. In offensive operations, these tools are used to systematically scan IP addresses within a network range, extracting data such as device type, IP addresses, and common service ports. Scripts can be written to automate these scans at various times to update topological maps quickly and efficiently. 

Example Nmap command for active probing:

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

This command performs a ping scan on the subnet 192.168.1.0/24 to identify live hosts. Active probing is beneficial for mapping networks with unknown devices but may trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS).

### Passive Analysis Methods

Unlike active probing, passive analysis involves monitoring network traffic to map out the network without injecting packets. This can be achieved by using tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze packets as they traverse the network. Passive methods are advantageous because they are less likely to alarm IDS, offering a stealthier reconnaissance approach. By analyzing traffic patterns, such as ARP requests and DHCP messages, an attacker can deduce network topology and device roles without direct interaction.

### Advanced Routing Protocol Mapping

Exploiting vulnerabilities in routing protocols can provide deeper insights into network topology. Protocols like BGP or OSPF exchange detailed routing information that can be captured and analyzed using route analytics tools. By carefully examining routing table exchanges and analyzing route advertisements, it is possible to map the network pathways and understand the routing decisions made within the network.

## Subnetwork Identification

Subnetwork identification focuses on recognizing and mapping distinct segments within a broader network. This can involve exploring virtual LANs (VLANs), identifying IP address space organization, and intercepting internal communications.

### VLAN Hopping Techniques

VLAN hopping refers to exploiting misconfigurations in VLAN setups to access network segments normally isolated from one another. Tools like Yersinia allow attackers to craft malicious packets that can traverse VLAN boundaries, enabling them to explore and map segregated network segments. This can lead to a richer understanding of network architecture by revealing hidden parts of the network.

Example Yersinia command for VLAN hopping:

```bash
yersinia -I
```

Running this tool in interactive mode can help execute attacks that reveal VLAN configurations and structure.

### CIDR and IP Address Space Enumeration

IP address space can be structured into different subnetworks using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notations. By examining captured data, attackers can determine how the address space is divided, identifying block allocations representative of different network segments. Tools and scripts designed for IP mapping can help enumerate and visualize these subnet structures, highlighting potential targets for attack.

### Sniffing and Spoofing Tactics

Techniques like ARP spoofing enable attackers to insert themselves into the network traffic flow, intercepting communications (a technique known as sniffing). By setting up sniffers on key communication nodes, attackers can capture packets traversing subnetworks, providing insights into the layout and function of each subnetwork. In combination with spoofing, attackers can also masquerade as legitimate devices to deepen reconnaissance or initiate man-in-the-middle attacks.

In synthesizing these techniques, network mapping acts as the foundational step in offensive cybersecurity to understand a target network holistically. By integrating findings from related topics like [Identifying Open Ports](#identifying-open-ports) and [OS and Version Detection](#os-and-version-detection), attackers can construct a comprehensive view of their target's ecosystem, strategizing further actions with precision.
