# Intelligence

## What Is Intelligence?

Intelligence in cybersecurity is the collection, processing, and analysis of information aimed at identifying, assessing, and mitigating cyber threats. It spans multiple levels to address both short-term and long-term needs, typically referred to as strategic, operational, and tactical. Strategic intelligence offers high-level insights for policy-making and helps guide an organization’s long-term security posture. Operational intelligence provides actionable information on emerging threats, trends, and vulnerabilities to inform day-to-day security tasks. Meanwhile, tactical intelligence focuses on the immediate, technical details—such as Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)—critical for detecting, responding to, and containing active threats.

## Why Is Intelligence Important?

A robust intelligence program underpins proactive, rather than reactive, cybersecurity strategies. By anticipating potential threats, organizations can strengthen weak points, align with risk management goals, and use resources more effectively. Intelligence also serves as a key decision-making tool, informing both rapid, tactical responses to incidents and broader, strategic decisions—like investing in new technologies or revising security policies to counter evolving risks. Moreover, understanding the likelihood and impact of different attack vectors enables better prioritization of defenses, reducing the potential harm to critical assets and preserving stakeholder trust. Lastly, timely sharing of intelligence insights fosters efficient and coordinated actions across teams, minimizing the window of opportunity for adversaries.

## How Is Intelligence Done?

Implementing an intelligence program involves a structured, end-to-end approach: from gathering raw information to transforming it into insights that can guide security decisions. Organizations typically source data from internal logs, external threat feeds, open-source intelligence, and industry collaboration channels. After collection, data undergoes processing and analysis to reveal patterns, identify risks, and establish context, ultimately leading to insights that can shape immediate incident responses and inform long-term security initiatives. Dissemination is crucial; presenting relevant intelligence to the right stakeholders at the right time maximizes its value and ensures a well-orchestrated defense. Finally, integrating intelligence into existing security controls, policies, and technologies creates a unified, holistic approach. Many organizations use established frameworks and methodologies—such as the Intelligence Cycle or MITRE ATT&CK—to streamline these processes, making sure threat intelligence remains actionable, up-to-date, and fully aligned with broader cybersecurity objectives.
